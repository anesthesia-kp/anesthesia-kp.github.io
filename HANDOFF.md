# HANDOFF — KP East Bay Anesthesia. Both sites.

**Read `START-HERE.md` first.** It carries the cardinal rule, every binding working rule, and
the current state of both sites. This file is the per-site detail behind it.

Nothing here restates a rule from `START-HERE.md`. If you find something that does, delete it
here and keep the copy there — that duplication is the disease this merge cured.

# ⭐ CLOSING A SESSION — the handoff checklist. Owner order, 25 Aug 2026.

*"Let's add to the handoff a set of instructions for the handoff that ensure everything is
updated and the chat is reviewed for important items."*

**This is a PROCEDURE, not a set of rules — the rules live in `START-HERE.md` and are not
restated here.** Work it top to bottom before saying a session is finished, and say in the
chat which steps ran. A step that was skipped is reported as skipped, never left silent.

**Run it at every handoff point, not only at the end** — before a compaction, before a long
gap, before "what's next?", and whenever the owner is about to walk away. A session that ends
without this ends in whatever half-state it happened to be in.

---

### 0 · `git fetch` EVERY repo FIRST — before reading anything to decide what is recorded

**A clone is not the project; `origin/main` is.** On 25 Aug the cloud clone was 8 commits behind,
had never been fetched, and Claude "discovered" that eight rulings, an owner instruction and a
gate fix were all missing. Every one of them was already committed and pushed. Committing the
reconstructions would have deleted 991 lines of the owner's own words.

**Absence in a working copy is evidence of NOTHING.** Fetch first, then grep — and when a file
seems to be missing something it should have, check `git log`/`git show origin/main:<file>`
before concluding it was never written.

### 1 · Review THE CHAT for things that must outlive it

This is the step that gets skipped, and it is the reason this checklist exists. **A session
is deleted; a file is not.** Re-read the conversation from its start (or from the compaction
summary plus everything after it) and pull out every item below. For each, decide its ONE home
(§ "a fact has ONE home"), write it there in this turn, and quote the owner verbatim where he
gave a ruling.

| what to look for | where it goes |
|---|---|
| **"that should be remembered" / "remember this" / "don't do that again"** — the owner saying something explicitly | the file that owns that subject, **in the same turn he says it** |
| A **ruling** — he chose between options, or overruled a recommendation | `DECISIONS.md`, numbered, including the argument he overruled and why |
| A **correction to how the work is done** (a preference, a boundary, a thing he does or does not do) | `START-HERE.md`, in the section that already covers it |
| A **correction of an existing rule** — anything that makes a sentence already in a file WRONG | edit that sentence. **Do not add a second, newer sentence beside it** — two answers is the rot |
| A **defect he found** that is not being fixed now | `TODO.md` |
| **What shipped**, and what the gates said | `BUILD-LOG.md`, one row per build |
| A **lesson from something that went wrong this session** | `HANDOFF.md` (here), dated |

⚠️ **Believing it was written down is not the same as it being written down.** On 24 Aug the
owner said *"I can run RA2, you built a system for me"* and *"that should be remembered"*. A
later session believed that was recorded in `START-HERE.md` §6; it was not, and §6 went on
stating the opposite blanket rule for a full day. **GREP FOR IT. Open the file and confirm the
sentence is on disk before reporting it as recorded.**

⚠️ **After a compaction, treat the summary as second-hand.** Everything before the compaction
reaches you as somebody's précis, not as the source. Re-ground the specific facts you are about
to act on by reading them off disk — `DECISIONS.md`, the code, `git show` — rather than
trusting the summary's paraphrase of them.

### 2 · Make the state files true

- **`node status.mjs`** from this repo. **It must exit 0.** It is the gate, not a report: it
  checks every build number `START-HERE.md` calls LIVE against **`origin/main`** (what the site
  is actually serving), checks that anything filed-but-unpushed is named, and checks the
  LAST REVISED date against git. If it cannot reach `origin/main` it says so LOUDLY — in that
  state, `git fetch` first and believe no build number until you have.
- **`START-HERE.md`** — the LIVE line, the `FILED, NOT YET PUSHED:` line, and LAST REVISED,
  bumped in the SAME turn as the edit. Delete the FILED line once it is pushed.
- **`BUILD-LOG.md`** — a row for every build, written at the same time as the code, in the
  repo the build belongs to.
- **`TODO.md`** — anything raised and not done. `status.mjs` rewrites its STATUS block; the
  rest is hand-kept. ⚠️ **And REMOVE from it anything whose `BUILD-LOG.md` row you just wrote,
  in this same turn** (standing rule, 25 Aug 2026). A fact lives in one of the three files —
  outstanding here, shipped in `BUILD-LOG.md`, settled in `DECISIONS.md`. The moment something
  ships, `TODO.md` is no longer its home. One deletion per build; skipping it is how that file
  grew to 2,600 lines and became something people skim instead of read.

### 3 · Prove the code

- Batteries run, with the numbers quoted from the RUN and never from memory or from a doc.
- **Every honesty check must say FAILED with a non-zero exit.** A skip is a failed gate.
- Name the baseline by its **explicit SHA**, and say so.
- `node --check` on every page touched.
- The **isolation guard** (the cardinal rule) re-run after anything that touches a writer.
- Say how many suites RAN and how many were SKIPPED. "All green" beside 22 skips is a lie.

### 4 · Account for every file

- `git status` in **all four** repos. Name every uncommitted file and say why it is uncommitted
  — a modified file nobody mentions is the one that gets lost.
- Anything the owner must push: **deliver the actual file** and give its md5. Do not describe a
  change and leave him to find it.
- `tests/` is **not a git clone in the cloud sandbox** — its files only exist there because they
  were staged. Anything edited there must be sent back explicitly or it dies with the session.
- If the cloud clone is BEHIND origin, say so. It is a fine place to build from a delivered
  whole file; it is **not** a safe base for a patch script.

### 5 · Hand over

State, in the chat: what shipped, what the gates said, what is pending a push, what was recorded
and where, and what is recommended but deliberately NOT built. Then stop and wait (§7).

# 🧹 MAINTAINING THIS FILE AND `TODO.md` — archiving is CONTINUOUS, not a spring clean

**Owner order, 25 Aug 2026: build the archiving into both files so the process is maintained.**
These two files grow every session and nothing ever left them, so by 25 Aug this file was ~2,300
lines and `TODO.md` ~2,600. **A file long enough to skim is a file that stops being read**, and
outstanding work then goes missing in plain sight — which is the opposite of what both exist for.

**The trigger is numeric ON PURPOSE**, for the same reason §62 made the commit cap a number:
drift that depends on judgement is drift nobody notices. Three rules, all mechanical:

**1 · `TODO.md` — shipped work leaves as it enters `BUILD-LOG.md`, in the SAME TURN.**
A fact lives in ONE of the three files — outstanding in `TODO.md`, shipped in `BUILD-LOG.md`,
settled in `DECISIONS.md`. The moment something ships, `TODO.md` is not its home. One deletion
per build. This is step 2 of the checklist above and it is where the rule is enforced.

**2 · THIS FILE — an entry leaves when it is NO LONGER NEEDED, never because it got old.**
Move it to `_archive/`, dated, in one file. **Never delete.**

> **Owner ruling, 25 Aug 2026, replacing the 14-day rule he set the day before** — verbatim:
> *"14 days doesn't seem reasonable. i want to remove items no longer needed rather than remove
> by time."* **He is right, and the first pass proved it from the other end:** the 14-day
> cut-off reached only four sections, because at 200–400 lines a session a fortnight of sessions
> is roughly this whole file. Age was buying nothing and spending judgement. A three-week-old
> trap that still bites matters more than yesterday's build narrative.

**AN ENTRY STAYS while it carries something a future session would ACT on:**
· a trap, a lesson or a gotcha still true of the code, the tools or the machines **as they are today**;
· an unresolved question, an accepted risk, or a limit nobody has worked around yet;
· the reasoning behind something still in force, where only the outcome is recorded elsewhere.

**AN ENTRY GOES once all of that is gone:**
· it is a build narrative and `BUILD-LOG.md` carries the row;
· its lesson has been promoted into `START-HERE.md` §3 or `DECISIONS.md` — the rule now lives
  where rules live, so the story here is the second copy, and second copies are what rot;
· it describes a machine, a tool, a file or a code path that **no longer exists**.

> ✅ **THE TEST, in one question: if a fresh session never read this entry, would it do anything
> wrong?** Yes → it stays. No → it goes. That is the whole rule.

> ⭐ **AND THE HABIT THAT MAKES IT WORK: promote the lesson, THEN archive the story.** An entry
> you cannot archive because its lesson lives nowhere else is not a reason to keep the entry —
> it is a sign the lesson was never filed properly. Put it where it belongs first
> (`START-HERE.md` §3 for a working rule, `DECISIONS.md` for a ruling), and the narrative is then
> free to go. Done this way the archive pass stops being tidying and becomes the thing that
> forces every hard-won lesson into the file a fresh session actually reads.

> ⛔ **NEVER ARCHIVED, whatever the test says:** the closing checklist above · this section ·
> PART A (shared), PART B (auction), PART C (schedule) and PART D (rescued records) ·
> ARCHITECTURE · DEPLOY FLOW · anything describing how the system WORKS rather than what happened
> on a day. Those are reference, not narrative. Only the **dated session entries** are ever
> archived.

**3a · `START-HERE.md` HAS A TRIPWIRE OF ITS OWN: 700 LINES** (owner ruling, 25 Aug 2026).
It is lower than the other two on purpose — it is the ONE file he PASTES into every session, so
every line in it is a tax on every session forever, where a line in `TODO.md` is read only when
someone goes looking. **And the rule that keeps it there: a working rule that has not been needed
in months moves to `START-HERE-ARCHIVE.md` rather than staying in the paste.** Same test as
everything else — if a fresh session never read it, would it do anything wrong?

**3 · THE TRIPWIRE — if either file passes 2,000 lines, the archive pass is DUE**, and it is
taken before the next feature build rather than "when there's time". Measure it, do not estimate:
`wc -l TODO.md HANDOFF.md`. `TODO.md` carries the full pass procedure and its acceptance
criteria in its §1 queue.

⚠️ **`DECISIONS.md` IS EXEMPT AND MUST NOT BE TRIMMED.** It is a register: it should only ever
grow, every entry stays live forever, and a ruling from July governs exactly as much as one from
today. Length there is correctness, not rot. Do not "tidy" it.

**The judgement call, and it only goes one way:** if you cannot say whether an item is shipped,
outstanding, parked or a standing rule, **it stays**. Uncertainty keeps it. Archiving something
still owed is far worse than a file that is fifty lines longer than it needed to be.

## 26 Aug 2026 (EVENING) — THE PIVOT BACK TO THE AUCTION, ONE OWNER-FOUND DEFECT, AND THE DECK

**Shipped (filed, awaiting his push): auction admin 305 (TM-1, §117).** Rulings §116 and §117.
Per-build detail is the `BUILD-LOG.md` row. The deck (34 slides) is filed as
`tests/docs/VacationAuctionWalkthrough.pptx` — one current copy, private repo, by his ruling that evening.

**THE DEFECT, and why the owner found it and no battery did.** Mode 2 (affects-others only) was
gated on the staff page since 154/274 and never on the admin page — build 289 added the admin
reset AFTER the modes existed and wired only the classic guards. Every suite that touched it
stubbed `_adminBidTimerReset: () => {}`, and test-admin-timer-289 asserted only that the reset
FIRES. Nothing asserted that it must sometimes NOT fire. **A guard with only positive cases is
half a guard.** The 305 suite has both halves, and runs the real projection engine under them.

**Three small things that cost time, so they are written down:**
· **A `//` comment appended inside an argument list swallows the closing bracket.** The 289
  re-anchor was first written that way and produced a SyntaxError; the comment goes on its own
  line above the call.
· **A background process over the bridge dies when the `device_bash` call returns.** `nohup … &
  disown` survived only when the same call also slept. The auction battery runs in ~25 s, which
  fits the 45 s call limit — **run it in the foreground** and read the exit code directly.
· **`test-crna-stamp` regenerates `crna/` IN PLACE as its check.** After an admin build its first
  run goes red on the drift assertion and leaves the restamped files on disk; the second run is
  green. That red is the stamper doing its job, and the restamped `crna/admin/index.html` +
  `crna/versions.json` are part of the build to push — not a regression to chase.

**Deck notes for whoever touches it next:** python-pptx re-serialises every part on save (bytes
change, meaning does not — verified by C14N) and drops the `jpg` content-type Default; the
fix is one line in `[Content_Types].xml`. The cover art on slide 1 is a parody built from a
640-px source with a traced silhouette; `make_cover.py` in the session workspace rebuilds it,
but that script is NOT in any repo. The FTE numbers on slides 26–27 and 7 come from the table
he photographed on 26 Aug (6/5/4 FTE; 235 FTE-weeks in Phases 1–3; +1 FTE on 34 weeks in
Phase 4, shown in amber and excluded from the totals by his instruction).

## 25–26 Aug 2026 — SIX BUILDS, AND EVERY ONE FOUND A GATE THAT WAS NOT LOOKING

**Shipped live: 99 · 100 · 101 · 102 · 103. Filed and awaiting a push: 104.** Per-build detail is
in `schedule/BUILD-LOG.md`. This entry is the pattern, which is the part a fresh session would
otherwise repeat.

**THE PATTERN.** Six builds, six instruments that were wrong:
· **99** — `toggleSect` ends in `else renderCatalog()`, so an unregistered key redraws an
  unrelated page. Found by a BEHAVIOURAL probe (plant a marker, toggle elsewhere, see if it
  survived), never by reading the source.
· **100** — a `/*` inside a LINE comment had opened a block comment **347,322 characters long**,
  so `build80-test`'s stripper was testing ~30% of the page and its `prompt()` gate never fired
  while a real blocking `prompt()` sat in the group rename.
· **101** — `sched/run-all.mjs` keeps a HAND-WRITTEN suite list, and builds 99, 100 and 101's
  suites were none of them in it. The battery reported *"49 suites, all green"* over three suites
  it had never heard of. The runner now **exits 2 and names them** if any suite on disk is
  unregistered.
· **103 and 104** — the extractor gotcha, twice: `build78`, then `build69`/`build70`, all extract
  a function and eval it alone, and all broke the moment that function grew a dependency.

⚠️ **AND CLAUDE ADDED TWO OF HIS OWN, which are the ones worth reading.**
**① A false claim, filed.** He reported that two red suites failed identically on three earlier
builds and wrote **"proven by execution"** on it, into `BUILD-LOG.md`. The bisect had never run:
those suites read `SCHED_ROOT` and he was passing `ADMIN=`. **The input was ignored rather than
rejected, so every run returned the same number — which is exactly what a clean result looks
like.** A subagent re-running it properly is what caught it. Now §3 rule 8's third kind.
**② A near-miss in 104.** Fixing the extractor break by extracting the REAL `staffingOn` bypassed
the fixture map `build69`/`build70` drive everything from, silently turning every day into "not
asked for". The right fix was to stub it **in the SHAPE of the real function** beside the
`demandOn` stub those suites always had — §3 rule 10's FAST-1 lesson, arriving from a new angle.

**THE THING TO CARRY: the code was fine and the instruments were not.** Every one of these was
found by RUNNING something, or by a second reader re-running it with different inputs. When a
gate agrees with you, ask what it would have said if it were broken.

**ON CONTEXT.** This session ran past **580,000 tokens with no compaction**, having started the
day with Claude asserting a 160,000-token ceiling as fact. The thresholds were invented twice and
overruled twice by the owner, and §106 now records what the number does and does not measure.

## 25 Aug 2026 (LATE) — THREE BUILDS, AND EVERY ONE OF THEM FOUND A LYING GATE

**Shipped: admin 99 (collapse sweep), 100 (group rename, stripper), 101 (§103 "Staffing").**
99 is live; 100 and 101 are filed and awaiting a push. Detail is in `schedule/BUILD-LOG.md`;
this entry exists for the pattern, which is the part a fresh session would otherwise repeat.

**THE PATTERN: every one of the three builds was gated green by something that was not looking.**
· **99** — `toggleSect` ends in `else renderCatalog()`, so an unregistered key re-draws an
  unrelated page. Caught by a BEHAVIOURAL probe (plant a marker, toggle elsewhere, see if it
  survived), not by reading the source.
· **100** — a `/*` inside a line comment had been blanking 70% of the page before `build80-test`
  read it, so its `prompt()` gate never fired while a real blocking `prompt()` sat in the code.
· **101** — `sched/run-all.mjs` keeps a HAND-WRITTEN suite list, and builds 99, 100 and 101's
  suites were none of them in it. The battery said *"49 suites, all green"* over three suites it
  had never heard of.

⚠️ **AND CLAUDE ADDED A FOURTH, WHICH IS THE ONE WORTH READING.** It reported that two red suites
failed identically on three earlier builds, wrote **"proven by execution"** on it, and filed that
into `BUILD-LOG.md`. The bisect had never run: those suites read `SCHED_ROOT`, and `ADMIN=` was
being passed. **The input was ignored rather than rejected, so every run returned the same number
— which is exactly what a clean result looks like.** A subagent re-running it properly is what
caught it. Corrected in the row and in `TODO.md`. The general form is now §3 rule 8's third kind.

**What that says about the day: the code was fine and the instruments were not.** Three of the
four were found only because something ran the thing rather than reading it, and the fourth was
found only because a second pair of eyes re-ran it with different inputs. **Run it, don't recall
it — and when a gate agrees with you, ask what it would have said if it were broken.**

## 25 Aug 2026 (ARCHIVE PASS) — the tripwire pass ran, and a gate that had been lying for a week

**No code shipped. Docs and one tooling fix.** Owner asleep for most of it, on a clear "do all
these"; everything is filed in the working tree and nothing is pushed.

**THE GATE THAT LIED, and it is the most reusable thing here.** `node status.mjs` opened the
session by declaring `START-HERE.md` STALE. It was not. The file said *25 Aug*; git said the last
commit touching it was *2026-08-24*. Both were right: the commit landed at **22:42 PDT on 24 Aug**,
which is already 25 Aug in UTC. **The old gate read its two clocks from different places** — the
git branch used `%cs`, the committer's LOCAL day (Pacific), while the not-yet-committed and mtime
branches used `new Date()`, the day of whatever BOX runs node (UTC in a cloud session, Pacific on
the Mac). So the same document could pass or fail depending on whether it happened to be committed
yet and on which machine asked. In practice it cried STALE for **seven hours out of every
twenty-four** — every session working past 5pm Pacific.

Fixed by pinning both sides to `America/Los_Angeles` (the owner types the date and the owner reads
it) and by asking the question the gate actually exists to ask: **does this document UNDER-report
its own age?** A stated day that is older than the last change is staleness. A stated day equal to
the change day, or one day after it, is the legitimate UTC/Pacific straddle. More than a day ahead
is a typo. **Proved four ways before it was trusted** — stated 17 Aug → exit 3 (the exact 17-Aug-
on-19-Aug failure the owner caught himself still fires) · 30 Aug → exit 3 as a typo · 25 Aug and
24 Aug → exit 0. The old gate on the same fixtures failed 24 Aug and passed 25 Aug on the mtime
branch, and did the exact reverse on the git branch — which is the bug, stated as a test.

**A gate that fails when nothing is wrong is the same disease as one that passes when something
is** — people stop reading both. Worth remembering the next time a green tick is the thing being
checked.








> ⚠️ **AND THE PASS CAUGHT ITSELF IN A LIE, which is worth more than the tidying.** Three bullets
> were cut in place and replaced with a note reading *"archived with the narrative"* — they were
> not; the surgery ran before the block move, so those lines existed nowhere. **The conservation
> check found it**: every line of the original is compared against the new file plus the archive,
> and anything in neither is listed. **Run that check on any pass that claims nothing was
> deleted.** A claim of conservation is worth exactly as much as the thing that verifies it.

⚠️ **A STANDING RISK, written down rather than acted on: `_archive/` IS NOT IN ANY GIT REPO.** It is
a plain folder under `~/Documents/GitHub`. The one place this project promises *nothing is ever
deleted* is the one place git has never seen — precisely the 22 Aug failure mode, when two
untracked files were recovered from iCloud with hours to spare. Every previous archive went there
too, so the convention was followed, not changed. **It is the owner's call whether it should be.**


# PART A — SHARED

## STILL-OPEN NOTES CARRIED OUT OF RA-3 (20 Aug 2026)

*The RA-3 narrative was archived 25 Aug 2026 under §101. These two blocks were kept because they
are not narrative: one is an OPEN item, the other is a do-not-quote list. Everything else RA-3
produced is in `DECISIONS.md` §75–§78 and in the private reports in `tests/docs/`.*

**OPEN — the sandbox button sweep must be made to fail loudly.**

* **It had been measuring nothing since App Check went in (19 Aug).**
  `make-site.mjs` faked four Firebase modules but not `firebase-app-check`; offline that
  import failed and took every page handler with it. The staff pass clicked **0** controls;
  the admin pass logged 325 copies of one error. FIXED and pushed (`af57c09`): a new
  `sweep/fake/firebase-app-check.js` plus one line in `make-site.mjs`. After the fix, with the
  driver restored byte-for-byte: **584 clicks · 261 dialogs · 154 confirms · 0 errors**, both
  sites, four passes. STILL OPEN: make the harness fail LOUDLY (zero clicks on a site, or more
  page errors than clicks, must exit non-zero) — this rot was silent.
*(Three further bullets stood here and were archived with the narrative: the bidder-page refusal
placement, which SHIPPED as staff 162's H-3; the live walkthrough record; and that session's
battery counts.)*

### RA-3 honesty notes — things that did NOT survive, recorded so nobody quotes them

* The CRITICAL's original evidence cited an in-file comment that **does not exist** — the wave
  deleted it; it survives only on the `-` side of the diff. The skeptic caught it. The finding
  stands on its other, verbatim-accurate quote and on the reproduction.
* The CRITICAL's second scenario ("a bid of 10 wins outright") is **not settled** — the two
  agents disagreed, the reproduction is ambiguous, and the denial in it looks like a policy
  denial. **Do not quote it.** The clean case is the E/D one above.
* A 20,000-scenario fuzz Claude wrote to size the problem **proved nothing** — it flagged
  near-identical counts on both engines, so its oracle cannot separate a legitimate cascade
  from an inversion. Only signal worth noting: weaker-bid REVIEW promotions 242 post-wave vs
  31 pre-wave.
* Two items Claude nearly reported were wrong and the code said so: the greyed NP chip already
  carries its own reason, and the "No limit" bid caps really are set to 6/6.
* `audit-handlers.mjs` now prints 1 violation where 0 is expected. It is a **false positive** —
  line 6991 is a COMMENT quoting an onclick pattern, and the auditor has no comment stripping.

## 4. ARCHITECTURE — unchanged (the 29 Jul handoff's §4 ten-line summary is still accurate)

Two static sites + schedule app sharing one Firestore. All logic inline `<script>`. Two
computeApprovals twins differ in SIGNATURE deliberately; port logic only. Mail relayed by any open
signed-in page. Rules enforce per-user bid confinement via emailToUser (now collision-fail-closed),
server-clock timer, biddingClosed gate, append-only changes, admin-only decisions/backups.

## 5. DEPLOY FLOW — unchanged. Rules changes publish in the console BEFORE dependent client pushes.


---

# PART B — VACATION AUCTION


### LIVE STATE THE OWNER OWNS — kept here as REFERENCE, not as a reminder (25 Aug 2026)

**He asked for these off the queue** — *"I know the launch checklist, I don't need reminders"* and,
of the sign-in test, *"I'll mention it if it becomes a problem, stop reminding me."* **They are
recorded here so a fresh session knows the state and does not ask him again. Do NOT surface them
as work, and do not re-add them to `TODO.md`.** The full LAUNCH CHECKLIST and the sign-in section
are in `_archive/anesthesia/superseded-docs/TODO-archived-2026-08-25.md`, intact.

· **Outbid-alert and welcome e-mails are BOTH switched OFF.** Verified by RA-5: switching them on
  fires **no backlog** — neither generator keeps a "last notified" state, so there is nothing to
  replay. Worst case is two mails per physician at their next individual sign-in.
· **Launch has not happened.** It is his, on his timing.
· **35 participating anesthesiologists** (owner, 19 Aug). Older docs saying ~60 meant the roster
  size, not the number bidding.
· **Real-bidder sign-ins** were being tested. Any count predating the roster update to 35 is
  stale and must be recounted, never repeated.

**LIVE. Build numbers live in `TODO.md`'s STATUS block, which is generated** — the ones typed
here read 269/139/17 until 25 Aug 2026, thirty-five auction builds out of date. The cardinal rule
in `START-HERE.md` exists to protect this site.

> ⚠️ **Sections dated 3 Aug and earlier are HISTORICAL.** They were accurate when written and
> are kept for the reasoning they contain, not as a statement of today. The build numbers above
> and in `versions.json` are authoritative — do not trust a date heading below over them.


## ⭐ BACKLOG — pending updates (added 11 Aug 2026, after the first live rehearsal)

**Live state ~~right now~~ AS OF 11 AUG — HISTORICAL, live is 269/139/17:** admin **264** (F1 fix: Begin-Phase-4 clears the round
mirrors locally before the Round-1 month picker reads them), staff index **135**, mobile **17**;
versions.json matches. First live rehearsal with real users ran clean. The only real issue was a
data-entry typo — a user's corrupted KP e-mail (`...Bielinski.kp@org`, `@` misplaced) made EmailJS
return `422 "recipients address is corrupted"`, so that mailQueue entry looped forever (~every 90s
via claim expiry) and held the red "outbid alerts queued" flash lit. Fixed by correcting the roster
address; no code change. That episode surfaced items 2–4 below.

**Do these as ONE batched build AFTER the rehearsal is fully done** — full gate on all, user
pushes, code-freeze discipline (propose → user go → smallest change). Items 1–4 are small and
self-contained; **item 5 is behavioral/fairness-critical and needs the read-only touchpoint map
FIRST**, for the user to sign off on before any edit.

1. **noindex tag** — keep the site out of Google. Today there is no `noindex` meta and no honored
   robots.txt (a robots.txt under `/vacation/` is ignored — robots.txt must live at the host root,
   which is the *separate* `anesthesia-kp.github.io` repo). Fix = add
   `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` to the `<head>` of admin/index.html AND staff
   index.html. ~2 lines. The site is NOT currently indexed (a `site:` search returns nothing), so
   no urgency.

2. **Mail-queue hardening** — a permanently-rejected address is retried forever, never quarantined,
   so one bad e-mail can hold the queue's red flash hostage (see the rehearsal issue above). Fix =
   after N failed sends, drop/park the entry with an admin-visible flag instead of looping. See
   `processMailQueue` (admin ~line 1742, staff ~line 1452) and the
   `console.warn('Queue send failed for', e.user, err)` catch.

3. **Relabel the queue counter** — the dashboard "Outbid alerts — N queued" counts the WHOLE
   mailQueue outbox (welcome + results + outbid), so a stuck welcome shows up as an "outbid alert."
   Rename to e.g. "Queued e-mails." Cosmetic; see `updateMailQueueBadge` (~line 1714).

4. **EmailJS sent-counter undercount** — RECURRING; a prior fix did NOT hold. User reset it from
   ~280 to ~390 (dropped ~a third of sends). [BELIEVED] cause = lost concurrent increments: a
   read-modify-write in `trackEmailSent()` gets clobbered when multiple sends/tabs fire at once.
   Fix = atomic Firestore `increment(1)`, not read-then-set. DIAGNOSE `trackEmailSent` + its
   persistence path and CONFIRM the mechanism before changing anything (same discipline we used on
   the queue). Meanwhile the EmailJS account dashboard is the true count.

5. **Make holiday weeks + auction year admin-configurable (with guardrails)** — REPLACES the
   one-off "move spring break to weeks 14 & 15." Goal: no annual code rewrite — designate holiday
   weeks and set the auction year from the controls section (same stored-config pattern as
   timerRules / FTE caps / Smart Lock Controls in `adminSettings`). This is BEHAVIORAL and
   fairness-critical: it feeds `HIGH_DEMAND_WEEKS` → Phase-1 Smart Lock, FTE caps/slots, holiday
   labels, reports, and the never-event guards. **REQUIRED FIRST STEP = a read-only touchpoint map
   of EVERY place spring break / weeks 14-15 / high-demand weeks / FTE caps / holiday labels are
   defined or referenced, for the USER to sign off on before ANY edit.** Then wire those reads to
   config, add validation + a lock so the values can't change once an auction is underway, full
   gate + targeted fairness tests. The map is safe to build anytime (it changes nothing).

# PART C — DAILY SCHEDULE


### TRAP — TWO WAYS A GATE READ SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT YOU THOUGHT (25 Aug 2026)

Both were found in one evening, both had been live for weeks, and both printed clean numbers.

**① `SCHED_ROOT`, not `ADMIN`.** Most schedule suites take their page from `SCHED_ROOT`;
`build99-test` and `build100-test` take theirs from `ADMIN`. Passing the wrong one is **ignored,
not rejected** — the suite silently tests the working tree and returns the same number for every
input, which reads exactly like a clean bisect. It produced a confident, false "proven by
execution" claim that reached `BUILD-LOG.md` before a re-run caught it. **Before believing any
bisect, change the input and check the OUTPUT changed.**

**③ A SUITE THAT IS NOT IN `sched/run-all.mjs` NEVER RUNS.** The list is hand-kept, and builds
99, 100 and 101's suites were all missing from it — written, passed by hand, then silent, while
the battery reported a confident total that did not include them. **Register it in the same turn
you write it**, and when a battery total looks unchanged after adding a suite, that is the tell.

**⚠ AND ONE STANDING RULE IS NOW IN DOUBT, IN A GOOD WAY (25 Aug).** The rule says anything
that must be COMMITTED is written with `device_bash`, because `device_commit_files` files were
once invisible to git over the bridge. **That has now failed to reproduce twice**: the four
`.pptx` files on 24 Aug, and `tests/sched/build102-test.mjs` today — delivered with
`device_commit_files`, md5-identical to the cloud copy, and listed by `git status` as `??`
immediately afterwards. Two clean observations is not a proof, but the rule was written *"until
it is understood"* and it is now the expensive option for a large file. **Worth the owner's word
before relaxing it; until then, keep verifying md5 AND `git status` after any such transfer.**

**② A `/*` inside a line comment.** `admin/index.html` has three (`// … dailysched/*, …`). Any
comment-stripper that removes block comments first will open a block there and delete everything
to the next real `*/` — measured at 347,322 characters. The page is valid JavaScript; the
stripper was the bug. **Strip line comments first, then block comments, and assert what survived.**

**Build numbers live in `TODO.md`'s STATUS block, which is generated** — the ones typed here
read 63/28 until 25 Aug 2026, thirty admin builds out of date. In active development.

## THE RULINGS — read them in `DECISIONS.md` (this repo), not here

An index of every ruling used to live here. It stopped at §41 while DECISIONS ran to §53b —
an incomplete copy claiming to be complete, which is worse than no copy. **`DECISIONS.md` is
the authority and its headings ARE the index** (§1–§53b, plus the buried-rulings index at
the end of that file). Do not re-litigate anything there; rulings marked as overruling
Claude mean Claude argued the opposite and was told no.

## Four traps a fresh session will fall into

1. **Module scope.** Both pages are one `<script type="module">`. A plain `function foo`
   is invisible to inline `onclick=`/`oninput=` handlers **and** to `page.evaluate` in
   tests. This has already caused one shipped-quality bug (`renderElig`, caught by the
   harness) and two false test failures. Expose with `window.foo=foo`, and assert through
   the DOM rather than by poking internals.
2. **The fake Firestore must fail like the real one.** `mergeFields()` catches an
   `updateDoc` rejection and retries with `setDoc`, so a one-shot denial is absorbed
   silently — `window.__denyPath` is sticky for that reason. And `tx.set` is synchronous
   in the real SDK; an earlier version of the fake dropped the rejected promise and
   reported denied writes as successful, which would have hidden exactly the bug class
   these tests exist to catch.
3. **A fixture's `versions.json` must match the `var BUILD` of the bytes under test.**
   From build 50 both pages carry a stale-build gate: on a mismatch the page reloads
   itself mid-run and wipes the seeded fakes. It looks exactly like a page bug and is not
   one — it cost most of an hour on 16 Aug. Both harnesses now read the number out of the
   file, so they keep working on every future build; do not reintroduce a hardcoded one.
4. **The fake auth starts SIGNED OUT.** Hiding `#authGate` is not enough — nothing has
   fired `onAuthStateChanged`, so the page never resolves who it is talking to and every
   grid renders header-only. Call `window.__signInNow()`. On 16 Aug this made `elig-test`
   report 8 failures against a page that was completely fine; adding the call took it
   straight back to 33/0 with no change to the page at all.

   Both of these have the same shape, and it is the shape to watch for: **a red test that
   is the harness's fault reads exactly like a red test that is the code's fault.** Before
   believing a new failure, run the same suite against the PREVIOUS build. If it fails
   there too, the harness moved, not the page.
5. **The `requiredBuilds` ratchet cannot be ported naively.** Whoever brings the auction's
   stale-build ratchet across must give it **its own key namespace**: the schedule's `PAGE`
   values are `'index'` and `'admin'` — the very same keys the auction ratchets — so a direct
   port would have schedule admin 93 compare itself against the AUCTION's admin build and
   reload-gate forever. (Promoted here 25 Aug 2026 from the 24 Aug schedule reconciliation,
   whose narrative was archived under §101.)

## Design artefacts — delivered, NOT built

`design/` holds six previews, three specs and a README (statuses corrected 17 Aug — several shipped; each file now carries a dated status banner). They are **mockups, not the app** — no
Firebase, no real data, every invented value labelled (§22).

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `elig-grid-preview.html` | the eligibility rebuild — **shipped in 49** |
| `shift-editor-preview.html` | stage 1 — times, sites, stacking demand rules, 60-day preview |
| `reports-preview.html` | stage 9 — **shipped in 51** |
| `REQUEST-TYPES.md` + `request-types-preview.html` | the owner's 27-entry Task list, modelled |
| `ASSIGNMENT-MODEL.md` + `assignment-model-preview.html` | stage 3 — the preview reproduces defect 2 live |
| `RULES.md` + `rules-preview.html` | stage 5 — **blocked on roles/groups**, two questions flagged |
| `shift-times.xlsx` | the owner's worksheet. **Not an import** — §38 parks every estimate |

## Next actions

**The queue lives in ONE place: `TODO.md` §1 (this repo).** The list that used to sit here
went stale within a day of being written (it still ordered a push that had long landed and
called defect 1 open after build 61 closed it). This file records what happened; TODO
orders what happens next.

# PART D — RESCUED RECORDS, 16 Aug 2026

Everything in this part existed in exactly ONE place, and that place was a file that looks
obsolete and was a candidate for archiving. It was lifted here on 16 Aug so that archiving
those files costs nothing. **Sources are named at each section; the source files keep their
original text as historical evidence.**

## D1 · Open residuals on the LIVE auction → the vacation section of `TODO.md`

The auction's deliberately-open defects and their mitigations have ONE home:
**the vacation section of `TODO.md` in this repo** (one-TODO ruling, 17 Aug). Do not restate them anywhere else; point there. It carries M1, M3, L2, L3, L4 and the cosmetic items, each with what neutralises it.

Two things to know without opening it:

- **M3 was never triaged, and it reproduces on the live build.** The two sites disagree about
  a doctor's e-mail address whenever that address contains a capital letter, because the KP
  address is not normalised on save and only one of the two sites lower-cases what it returns.
  Reproduced 16 Aug by extracting and executing both sites' real functions. Whether it has
  ever fired depends on whether any stored KP address has a capital letter — a data question,
  answerable on the admin Users page.
- **M1's mitigation is complete and is an operating habit, not code:** a single admin runs the
  auction. The same is true of L3: after Reset Auction, Global Lock ON until Begin Phase 1.

> ⚠️ **ID COLLISION.** Part B of this file contains items also labelled **M1, L2 and L3** —
> those are the **31 Jul Batch-D** numbering and are different, closed defects. The residuals
> file uses the **25 Jul code-review** numbering. Never quote a bare ID; name the list.

## D2 · Phase 4 — rounds as mini-phases. The lifecycle, in one place

*(18 Aug 2026: the REHEARSAL's phase 4 was skipped by owner ruling — this lifecycle was never exercised live. It remains the reference for real phases run with rounds.)*

*Rescued from NEXT-SESSION-PROMPT-2026-08-11 (now `_archive/tests/session-docs/`), which was the only
human-readable description of this machine anywhere in the project. The mechanism is
implemented in both pages and pinned by `tests/test-p4-rounds.mjs` (154 assertions) — but a
suite tells you what breaks, not how the thing is meant to work.*

**In plain terms:** Phase 4 is not one phase with many decisions. It is a series of small
phases. Each round closes, gets decided, gets archived, gets mailed, and only then does the
next round open. Nothing a doctor sees moves until the results for that round have actually
been sent.

**The sequence, quoted from the 11 Aug record:**

> close bidding → decide → Complete Round N (archives to admin-only staging `pendingP4Rounds`)
> → Send Round N Results (mails that round, publishes archive to `phases.p4Rounds[N]` +
> `p4RoundResultsSent[N]`) → Start Round N+1 (retires denied bids from `schedule` + `bidPhase`,
> clears approvals/denials/worstBids docs, `p4Round++`, smart-lock reopen) → … → Complete
> Phase 4 (gated: current round archived, all rounds sent, no orphan live decisions; year
> record = union of round archives; finish via `_p4FinishStamp`).

**The invariants, likewise quoted:**

> announced round wins lock via `getPriorPhaseWinners` (`p4RoundWinnersOn`) on BOTH sites;
> announced denials freeze until retirement (staff `p4AnnouncedDecision`); unsent results never
> visible to users; archived decisions immutable (`_p4ArchivedDecisionRound` guards
> approve/deny/revoke, pending counts, decide panel); plain Reopen redirects to Start Round
> when round archived; reports/history/filters treat rounds like phases ('Phase 4: Round N').

**Why each invariant is there, in one line:** results are not visible before they are sent, so
nobody learns their outcome early. An archived round cannot be re-decided, so the record of
what was announced cannot drift. Both sites agree on who won, so the two pages never show
different answers to the same doctor.

## D2a · Requested next auction feature (17 Aug 2026) — capacity-by-week report

The owner's first post-Phase-3 feature request: a report on the Reports dash, beneath the
user summaries, showing **each week of the year with what's been taken and what's
available**, styled like the existing reports. Verbatim wording and the one open scoping
question were in `TODO.md` §1 B4. **B4 SHIPPED as build 271 and B4's entry was archived
25 Aug 2026** to `_archive/anesthesia/superseded-docs/TODO-archived-2026-08-25.md`; the shipped record is the
build-271 row of `vacation-kp.github.io/BUILD-LOG.md`. This note is kept as the dated record of
when the feature was queued.

## D3 · A dated capacity ceiling on a live document

*Same source, and it appeared nowhere else in the project.*

> phases doc grows ~20KB/round (watch vs 1MB late 2027)

The `phases` document grows by roughly 20KB each Phase-4 round. Firestore caps a single
document at 1MB. On the growth rate observed in August 2026 that becomes a problem around late
2027. **This is not urgent and it is not theoretical** — it is a dated arithmetic fact about a
document the live auction writes every round. Tracked as a watch item in
`vacation-kp.github.io/TODO.md`.

---

## D4 · Operating habits for the live auction

*Rescued from §5 of SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-08-07 (now `_archive/tests/session-docs/`). Several of these are carried
elsewhere already; the three marked ★ were carried nowhere.*

1. **Run as the sole admin.** Most residual risks require two simultaneous admins.
2. **The timer may expire on its own** — safe since build 244. The admin machine's clock should
   be OS-synced. ★ **Keep one admin page open at and after expiry** so auto-close can fire; the
   manual Close Bidding path still works either way.
3. **Rehearsal Mode was once found unexpectedly OFF.** Verify the banner state before a
   rehearsal (ON) and before a real launch (OFF). Reset keeps it armed by design.
4. **After any Reset:** Global Lock ON until Begin Phase 1. See L3 in the residuals file.
5. **E-mail quota:** the in-app meter is advisory; **EmailJS's dashboard is the source of
   truth.** ★ The app's cycle resets on a configurable day, **default the 22nd**, which may
   differ from EmailJS's own billing day — that mismatch is why the meter can under-state.
6. **Send (or rehearsal-skip) each phase's results before beginning the next phase.** Build 245
   auto-targets an earlier unsent phase, but do not rely on it live.
7. ★ **Don't reload the admin dashboard mid-presentation**, and give it ~2s after opening.

---

## D5 · Accepted design decisions — do NOT relitigate

*Rescued from §6 of the same file. The first is carried in Part A; the rest were carried
nowhere.*

- `computeApprovals` has deliberately different signatures on the two sites (admin: an
  `ignoreAdmin` boolean; staff: a schedule snapshot). Port the logic only, never the signature.
- Reset Auction keeps Rehearsal Mode armed.
- **Review overage up to 1.0 is allowed**, and overage locks while the current phase has bids —
  including after the final phase. A reset clears it.
- **No e-mail-domain restriction.** *(Settled July 2026. Anything that would refuse an address
  for its domain — including a non-blocking "that doesn't look like a KP address" warning — is
  a change to this decision and needs the owner to say so explicitly.)*
- Passcodes are retired. The staff site does not auto-reconnect.
- The NP phase toggle is superseded by the high-demand week rule: Phase-1 weeks are all
  high-demand, so an NP-in-P1 toggle is moot. That is correct behaviour, not a bug.
- **Priority-lock OFF legalises below-floor bids, and re-enabling it does not unwind them.**
- **Raising a cap auto-raises later phases' caps.**
