# HANDOFF — KP East Bay Anesthesia. Both sites.
<!-- answers: how a session closes (the checklist), how the files are maintained, the standing traps of the tools and machines, PART A–D reference and D1–D5, and the latest session entries; read the checklist before any hand-over -->

**Read `START-HERE.md` first.** It carries the cardinal rule, every binding working rule, and
the current state of both sites. This file is the per-site detail behind it.

Nothing here restates a rule from `START-HERE.md`. If you find something that does, delete it
here and keep the copy there — that duplication is the disease this merge cured.

# ⭐ CLOSING A SESSION — the handoff checklist. Owner order, 25 Aug 2026.

*"Let's add to the handoff a set of instructions for the handoff that ensure everything is
updated and the chat is reviewed for important items."*

**This is a PROCEDURE, not a set of rules — the rules live in `START-HERE.md` and are not
restated here.** Work it top to bottom before saying a session is finished, and say in the
chat which steps ran. A step that was skipped is reported as skipped, never left silent.

**Run it at every handoff point, not only at the end** — before a compaction, before a long
gap, before "what's next?", and whenever the owner is about to walk away. A session that ends
without this ends in whatever half-state it happened to be in.

---

### 0 · `git fetch` EVERY repo FIRST — before reading anything to decide what is recorded

**A clone is not the project; `origin/main` is.** On 25 Aug the cloud clone was 8 commits behind,
had never been fetched, and Claude "discovered" that eight rulings, an owner instruction and a
gate fix were all missing. Every one of them was already committed and pushed. Committing the
reconstructions would have deleted 991 lines of the owner's own words.

**Absence in a working copy is evidence of NOTHING.** Fetch first, then grep — and when a file
seems to be missing something it should have, check `git log`/`git show origin/main:<file>`
before concluding it was never written.

### 1 · Review THE CHAT for things that must outlive it

This is the step that gets skipped, and it is the reason this checklist exists. **A session
is deleted; a file is not.** Re-read the conversation from its start (or from the compaction
summary plus everything after it) and pull out every item below. For each, decide its ONE home
(§ "a fact has ONE home"), write it there in this turn, and quote the owner verbatim where he
gave a ruling.

| what to look for | where it goes |
|---|---|
| **"that should be remembered" / "remember this" / "don't do that again"** — the owner saying something explicitly | the file that owns that subject, **in the same turn he says it** |
| A **ruling** — he chose between options, or overruled a recommendation | `DECISIONS.md`, numbered, including the argument he overruled and why |
| A **correction to how the work is done** (a preference, a boundary, a thing he does or does not do) | `START-HERE.md`, in the section that already covers it |
| A **correction of an existing rule** — anything that makes a sentence already in a file WRONG | edit that sentence. **Do not add a second, newer sentence beside it** — two answers is the rot |
| A **defect he found** that is not being fixed now | `TODO.md` |
| **What shipped**, and what the gates said | `BUILD-LOG.md`, one row per build |
| A **lesson from something that went wrong this session** | `HANDOFF.md` (here), dated |

⚠️ **Believing it was written down is not the same as it being written down.** On 24 Aug the
owner said *"I can run RA2, you built a system for me"* and *"that should be remembered"*. A
later session believed that was recorded in `START-HERE.md` §6; it was not, and §6 went on
stating the opposite blanket rule for a full day. **GREP FOR IT. Open the file and confirm the
sentence is on disk before reporting it as recorded.**

⚠️ **After a compaction, treat the summary as second-hand.** Everything before the compaction
reaches you as somebody's précis, not as the source. Re-ground the specific facts you are about
to act on by reading them off disk — `DECISIONS.md`, the code, `git show` — rather than
trusting the summary's paraphrase of them.

### 2 · Make the state files true

- **`node status.mjs`** from this repo. **It must exit 0.** It is the gate, not a report: it
  checks every build number `START-HERE.md` calls LIVE against **`origin/main`** (what the site
  is actually serving), checks that anything filed-but-unpushed is named, checks the
  LAST REVISED date against git, regenerates START-HERE's MAP and the DECISIONS index, and
  measures every governing file against its tripwire (§188). If it cannot reach `origin/main` it says so LOUDLY — in that
  state, `git fetch` first and believe no build number until you have.
- **`START-HERE.md`** — the LIVE line, the `FILED, NOT YET PUSHED:` line, and LAST REVISED,
  bumped in the SAME turn as the edit. Delete the FILED line once it is pushed.
- **`BUILD-LOG.md`** — a row for every build, written at the same time as the code, in the
  repo the build belongs to.
- **Over a tripwire?** `status.mjs` says so and exits non-zero. Promote any lesson first (a working rule → START-HERE §3,
  a tool trap → the STANDING TRAPS section, a ruling → DECISIONS), then `node archive.mjs <file> "<heading>"` for each
  section that fails the §101 test, then re-run until it exits 0. Uncertainty keeps a section.
- **`TODO.md`** — anything raised and not done. `status.mjs` rewrites its STATUS block; the
  rest is hand-kept. ⚠️ **And REMOVE from it anything whose `BUILD-LOG.md` row you just wrote,
  in this same turn** (standing rule, 25 Aug 2026). A fact lives in one of the three files —
  outstanding here, shipped in `BUILD-LOG.md`, settled in `DECISIONS.md`. The moment something
  ships, `TODO.md` is no longer its home. One deletion per build; skipping it is how that file
  grew to 2,600 lines and became something people skim instead of read.

### 3 · Prove the code

- Batteries run, with the numbers quoted from the RUN and never from memory or from a doc.
- **Every honesty check must say FAILED with a non-zero exit.** A skip is a failed gate.
- Name the baseline by its **explicit SHA**, and say so.
- `node --check` on every page touched.
- The **isolation guard** (the cardinal rule) re-run after anything that touches a writer.
- Say how many suites RAN and how many were SKIPPED. "All green" beside 22 skips is a lie.

### 4 · Account for every file

- `git status` in **all four** repos. Name every uncommitted file and say why it is uncommitted
  — a modified file nobody mentions is the one that gets lost.
- Anything the owner must push: **deliver the actual file** and give its md5. Do not describe a
  change and leave him to find it.
- `tests/` is **not a git clone in the cloud sandbox** — its files only exist there because they
  were staged. Anything edited there must be sent back explicitly or it dies with the session.
- If the cloud clone is BEHIND origin, say so. It is a fine place to build from a delivered
  whole file; it is **not** a safe base for a patch script.

### 4a · Take the rubbish out — the housekeeping step (owner order, 31 Aug 2026)

*"the files in my github folder are piling up with older files that i don't need or use… can you
ensure it happens automatically going forward?"* On 31 Aug `_to_delete/` had reached **151 MB across
403 entries** — spent transfer zips, old build snapshots and about forty empty lock folders — because
it is the owner's job to empty it and nothing ever reminded him. It is now empty. Keep it that way.

**The three destinations, and the one-line test for each.** This is the whole filing system:

| where | what goes there | who empties it |
|---|---|---|
| the repo itself | anything LIVE or in flight | nobody — it is the project |
| `_archive/<area>/<category>/` | superseded but real: old audit reports, retired suites, prior revisions of a document, session records. Areas are `vacation`, `schedule`, `tests`, `anesthesia` — **use those four, never invent a sibling** | **NOBODY — `_archive` is KEPT FOREVER.** "Nothing is ever deleted" means archived, not erased |
| `_to_delete/` | true machine junk with no historical value: spent transfer zips and tarballs, stranded `.lock` files, empty directories, probe and scratch files, `firestore-debug.log`, `.DS_Store` | **the owner, and it should be empty at every handoff** |

**The test that decides between the last two:** *would anyone ever want to read this again?*
Yes → `_archive/`. No, it is a byproduct of moving bytes around → `_to_delete/`.
**Genuinely unsure → `_archive/`.** It costs a few kilobytes to be wrong in that direction and
costs the owner his history to be wrong in the other.

**Before anything leaves a repo:** grep the WHOLE GitHub folder for its name. If a document is the
only copy of something — a ruling, a finding, a decision — its CONTENT must already be in
`DECISIONS.md` / `TODO.md` / `HANDOFF.md` / `BUILD-LOG.md` before the file moves anywhere. On 31 Aug
three files in `_to_delete/xfer/` turned out to be sole copies (`RULINGS-98-99.md`,
`todo-section3.md`, `card95.txt`) and were pulled back into `_archive/anesthesia/session-docs/`
rather than deleted. **Never move what the live site serves** — the hash-named HTML files are LIVE
REDIRECTS; open one and read its `<title>` before touching it.

**How this is now automatic — three layers, because a rule alone already failed once:**
1. **`node status.mjs` measures `_to_delete/` and `_archive/` and writes a 🧹 line into the STATUS
   block at the top of `TODO.md`.** That runs after every push, so the pile is now visible in the
   first thing anyone reads. Over 50 MB it says so in bold. It only ever REPORTS — it deletes nothing.
2. **This step.** Every handoff: read that 🧹 line, file anything loose, and if `_to_delete/` is not
   empty, tell him in the handover with the size.
3. **The deletion itself needs him or a permission grant.** The device bridge cannot delete by
   default; `device_request_delete_permission` puts a prompt on his Mac and a person must answer it.
   So Claude may ASK to empty `_to_delete/`, and may never quietly do it. If he declines or is away,
   say the folder is full and move on — never delete around the refusal, and never touch `_archive/`.

**Housekeeping is its own commit** (START-HERE §3) and every move is recorded in `_archive/README.md`.

### 5 · Hand over

State, in the chat: what shipped, what the gates said, what is pending a push, what was recorded
and where, and what is recommended but deliberately NOT built. Then stop and wait (§7).

---

# 🧹 MAINTAINING THIS FILE AND `TODO.md` — archiving is CONTINUOUS, not a spring clean

**Owner order, 25 Aug 2026: build the archiving into both files so the process is maintained.**
These two files grow every session and nothing ever left them, so by 25 Aug this file was ~2,300
lines and `TODO.md` ~2,600. **A file long enough to skim is a file that stops being read**, and
outstanding work then goes missing in plain sight — which is the opposite of what both exist for.

**The trigger is numeric ON PURPOSE**, for the same reason §62 made the commit cap a number:
drift that depends on judgement is drift nobody notices. Three rules, all mechanical:

**1 · `TODO.md` — shipped work leaves as it enters `BUILD-LOG.md`, in the SAME TURN.**
A fact lives in ONE of the three files — outstanding in `TODO.md`, shipped in `BUILD-LOG.md`,
settled in `DECISIONS.md`. The moment something ships, `TODO.md` is not its home. One deletion
per build. This is step 2 of the checklist above and it is where the rule is enforced.

**2 · THIS FILE — an entry leaves when it is NO LONGER NEEDED, never because it got old.**
Move it with `node archive.mjs HANDOFF.md "<heading>"` to `HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md` (this repo), verbatim, dated. **Never delete.**

> **Owner ruling, 25 Aug 2026, replacing the 14-day rule he set the day before** — verbatim:
> *"14 days doesn't seem reasonable. i want to remove items no longer needed rather than remove
> by time."* **He is right, and the first pass proved it from the other end:** the 14-day
> cut-off reached only four sections, because at 200–400 lines a session a fortnight of sessions
> is roughly this whole file. Age was buying nothing and spending judgement. A three-week-old
> trap that still bites matters more than yesterday's build narrative.

**AN ENTRY STAYS while it carries something a future session would ACT on:**
· a trap, a lesson or a gotcha still true of the code, the tools or the machines **as they are today**;
· an unresolved question, an accepted risk, or a limit nobody has worked around yet;
· the reasoning behind something still in force, where only the outcome is recorded elsewhere.

**AN ENTRY GOES once all of that is gone:**
· it is a build narrative and `BUILD-LOG.md` carries the row;
· its lesson has been promoted into `START-HERE.md` §3 or `DECISIONS.md` — the rule now lives
  where rules live, so the story here is the second copy, and second copies are what rot;
· it describes a machine, a tool, a file or a code path that **no longer exists**.

> ✅ **THE TEST, in one question: if a fresh session never read this entry, would it do anything
> wrong?** Yes → it stays. No → it goes. That is the whole rule.

> ⭐ **AND THE HABIT THAT MAKES IT WORK: promote the lesson, THEN archive the story.** An entry
> you cannot archive because its lesson lives nowhere else is not a reason to keep the entry —
> it is a sign the lesson was never filed properly. Put it where it belongs first
> (`START-HERE.md` §3 for a working rule, `DECISIONS.md` for a ruling), and the narrative is then
> free to go. Done this way the archive pass stops being tidying and becomes the thing that
> forces every hard-won lesson into the file a fresh session actually reads.

> ⛔ **NEVER ARCHIVED, whatever the test says:** the closing checklist above · this section · the
> STANDING TRAPS section below · PART A (shared), PART B (auction), PART C (schedule) and PART D (rescued records) ·
> ARCHITECTURE · DEPLOY FLOW · anything describing how the system WORKS rather than what happened
> on a day. Those are reference, not narrative. Only the **dated session entries** are ever
> archived.

**3a · `START-HERE.md` HAS A TRIPWIRE OF ITS OWN: 350 LINES** (owner ruling, 25 Aug 2026, lowered from 700 by §188 on 7 Sep 2026 and ENFORCED by `node status.mjs`, which exits non-zero over it).
It is lower than the other two on purpose — it is the ONE file he PASTES into every session, so
every line in it is a tax on every session forever, where a line in `TODO.md` is read only when
someone goes looking. **And the rule that keeps it there: a working rule that has not been needed
in months moves to `START-HERE-ARCHIVE.md` rather than staying in the paste.** Same test as
everything else — if a fresh session never read it, would it do anything wrong?

**3 · THE TRIPWIRES — `TODO.md` 700 lines, this file 900 (§188, 7 Sep 2026; they were 2,000). Over either, the
archive pass is DUE**, and it is taken before the next feature build rather than "when there's time". Nobody measures
it by hand: `node status.mjs` counts every governing file on every run, prints the counts in the STATUS block and
EXITS NON-ZERO naming the file — the same exit that means "START-HERE is stale". The pass itself is `archive.mjs`,
one section per call, verbatim into the file's `-ARCHIVE.md`; `docs-pass-check.mjs` proves a whole pass lost nothing.

⚠️ **`DECISIONS.md` IS EXEMPT AND MUST NOT BE TRIMMED.** It is a register: it should only ever
grow, every entry stays live forever, and a ruling from July governs exactly as much as one from
today. Length there is correctness, not rot. Do not "tidy" it.

**The judgement call, and it only goes one way:** if you cannot say whether an item is shipped,
outstanding, parked or a standing rule, **it stays**. Uncertainty keeps it. Archiving something
still owed is far worse than a file that is fifty lines longer than it needed to be.

---

# 🪤 STANDING TRAPS — the tools and machines as they are today. Promoted from dated entries; NEVER ARCHIVED.

The rules live in `START-HERE.md` §3 and §6; these are the tool-level gotchas that cost a session an hour each,
one line per trap, dated by the session that paid for it (the full story: `HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md`, by that date).
Add a line the turn a new one is paid for. Retire a line only when the tool or machine it describes is gone.

**The Mac and the bridge**
- The Mac sleeps the moment he walks away and the bridge drops with it (the fix is START-HERE §4). A `device_bash` or
  `device_commit_files` call that returned an error may still have LANDED — check before repeating it (1 Sep, 4 Sep).
- A background process started in `device_bash` dies when the call returns, `setsid nohup` included. The shape that works
  is a resumable chunk runner (~145 s of work per call, a done-list on disk, called until it prints ALL-DONE) (4 Sep).
- `device_bash` has an argument-size limit (E2BIG): a long heredoc goes over in two (29 Aug).
- `md5` does not exist in the device VM — it is Linux: `md5sum` (1 Sep). `rsync` is not in the cloud container: `cp -r` (1 Sep).
- The device VM's clock has run ~14 hours slow. When a timestamp matters, read `date -u` in BOTH shells and believe the one
  git agrees with; the session date is always `TZ=America/Los_Angeles date` (4 Sep, 7 Sep).
- The desktop app writes a `Claude outputs/` folder INSIDE the first connected folder — the hub repo — and GitHub Desktop
  shows it untracked; `git status` shows `?? "Claude outputs/"`. It is gitignored here now; move any copy to `_to_delete/` (3 Sep).
- Two copies of the docs repo (the Mac's and a cloud clone) diverge when both are edited. One copy is the truth at a time;
  say which, and re-stage the Mac's before building on the cloud's (30 Aug).
- Files delivered with `device_commit_files` are not seen as untracked by git over the bridge: anything that must be
  COMMITTED is written with `device_bash` or unpacked with `unzip -p`; `device_commit_files` is delivery only (24 Aug).

**The cloud container**
- `~` is `/root`, not `/home/claude`. Use absolute paths everywhere; `REPO_ROOT` must be absolute (31 Aug, 8 Sep).
- The vacation repo's remote is `https://github.com/anesthesia-kp/vacation.git` — the folder name is not the repo name;
  the hub and `schedule` clone under `anesthesia-kp/` by their folder names; `git ls-remote` against a guessed name is
  refused by the sandbox (4–5 Sep). `tests` is private: tar it on the Mac (minus `node_modules`) and stage it (§6).
- ESM `import` ignores `NODE_PATH`: symlink the global `playwright` and `playwright-core` (or the whole global
  `node_modules`) into `tests/node_modules/` or every browser suite is a silent skip (31 Aug, 2 Sep, 4 Sep).
- The sandbox's Chromium and the pinned Playwright disagree on build numbers and folder names, and the sweep driver wants
  the HEADLESS SHELL binary too — the symlink recipe is START-HERE §6; the numbers change (1 Sep, 5 Sep).
- The Bash tool kills a foreground call at ~5 min (exit 137). A longer battery runs detached, and a detached `sh -c`
  inherits its cwd — `cd` inside the command, poll the log's mtime, and check `/proc/<pid>/cwd` before trusting a log's
  name (29 Aug, 2 Sep).
- `pkill -f '<pattern>'` and `pgrep -f` match the tool shell's OWN command line — the first kills the shell, the second
  reports a dead run as RUNNING. Use `kill $(pgrep -x node)` and the log's mtime (29 Aug, 3 Sep; START-HERE §3 r8).
- A redirect to `/tmp/<name>` can hit a file another session left and be refused, and `tail` then prints the STALE file
  as if it were the run. Write logs under `$HOME`; check the log's mtime against `date` (1 Sep).
- The session's safety classifier sometimes blocks Reset / Delete steps as destructive; it clears on retry. Say so and
  let him decide; do not fight it (31 Aug).

**Batteries and honesty runs** (the rules are START-HERE §3 and §6; these are the mechanics)
- A battery run against the working tree is contaminated by the next edit — `versions.json matches var BUILD` goes red
  four times and looks like four regressions. Snapshot the tree and run the copy (30 Aug). Two suites on one port fight:
  `PORT=` the hand run (30 Aug). Never kill processes while a battery is warming up (30 Aug).
- Save the honesty fixture in the same breath as the bump. A build written over before its fixture was taken has NO
  fixture: rebuild it by re-applying the patch (30 Aug), or baseline on the last PUSHED build and say so (1 Sep).
- Five auction suites default their honesty baseline to `/mnt/user-data/uploads/GitHub/vacation-kp.github.io/admin/index.html`
  — exactly where `device_stage_files` drops the CURRENT build (the schedule twin is START-HERE §6). Move the staged copy
  aside or set `PREFIX_SRC` (1 Sep).
- `test-crna-stamp` regenerates `crna/` IN PLACE: after an admin build its first run is red and leaves restamped files that
  are PART OF THE BUILD; the second run is green (26 Aug).
- Record the TERMINAL call (`commit`, `persist`, `send`) and assert on it — `test-backup-restore`'s harness never reached
  `commit()` for months and was green on a half-run (5 Sep). A `typeof helper==='function'` guard is a silent no-op in a
  test sandbox: name the helper in `need` or call it unguarded (5 Sep). A helper called inside a try/catch that swallows
  ReferenceError must be NAMED in fixed sandboxes — the auto-resolver never sees it (2 Sep).
- The sweep fixture (`tests/sweep/site/fake/seed.js`) has no completed phases and no Phase-4 rounds: the sweep proves no
  regression and NOTHING about archive or round paths (1 Sep). Its staff/confirm `unlocated=1` on the default seed is
  pre-existing (1 Sep). Its fake `doc()` was fixed to be variadic on 5 Sep — cloud backup/restore now runs in it.
- Mutation runs (fifty-odd planted one-line breakages across the whole battery, ~33 s) find what green suites miss;
  part of any audit of a build that adds a guard (5 Sep).
- A `//` comment appended inside an argument list swallows the closing bracket (26 Aug). A section key that is a
  superstring of another key (`printshifts` ⊃ `shifts`) breaks every loose selector (26 Aug).

**Driving Chrome on the live site** (the rehearsal record: `tests/docs/REHEARSAL-2026-09-07.md`)
- A background tab lies about time — Chrome throttles it; foreground it (a screenshot) before reading, and trust the
  painted screenshot over `innerText` (7 Sep).
- Click the page's own buttons; a report opened from script is a blocked pop-up. When a pop-up cannot be read
  (`about:blank` is off-limits to the extension), capture the HTML in-page (7 Sep).
- `find` can resolve to the wrong row and open a real change dialog; address rows by their `onclick` target, never by
  description, when a wrong click writes (7 Sep).
- Screenshot pixels are CSS pixels × 1.133 here (1568/1384): get rects from `getBoundingClientRect()` and scale, never
  eyeball (31 Aug). Screenshot-free work leaves him unable to see where you are — say where, every time (31 Aug).
- Chrome-control screenshots land in the CLOUD container (`/tmp/claude-chrome-screenshots-<id>/`), not on the Mac —
  open them there with PIL; never ask him to drag files (24 Aug).

**Method — the lessons that are not tool-specific and not yet a numbered rule**
- A negative finding is only as wide as the fixture that produced it: put the scope IN the sentence ("no double-counting
  for phases; rounds untested"), never in a caveat further down (1 Sep, RA-7).
- Fix the CLASS, not the instance: when a defect is a shape, grep for every surface with that shape before calling it
  done — §149/§150, 312/D5, D8/E1/G1 were each the same defect found one screen at a time (1 Sep).
- A defect described from code is a hypothesis about what a human sees; look at the served page with his eyes before
  calling a build done (1 Sep, 4 Sep). A guard's comment says what it prevents, never whether it is the only way — find the
  rule it papers over before defending it (2 Sep).
- A stub can INVENT a finding as easily as hide one; a fixture that models an impossible state passes for the wrong
  reason; a probe that cannot distinguish the two answers is not evidence (1 Sep, 2 Sep).
- Lead with the supply/demand ratio in any capacity analysis; the grid is the appendix (3 Sep).

**Records and paperwork**
- GitHub Desktop pre-fills the Summary on a ONE-file commit and the pasted message is LOST (proved by a controlled
  comparison, 1 Sep). The structural fix (a suites index) was DECLINED (§157): say so in the handover, tell him to clear
  the box, and prefer two-file commits where honest.
- `_archive/` is not in any git repo — the one place that promises nothing is deleted is the one place git has never seen.
  His call, unacted since 25 Aug. The three repo archives (`*-ARCHIVE.md`) ARE in git.
- Three BUILD-LOG rows are missing (schedule 96; the CRNA stamper's 17 Aug work; the 18 Aug UX-PLAN directive) — his
  call, listed in TODO (25 Aug).
- `sched/run-all.mjs` keeps a hand-written suite list; the runner exits 2 naming any unregistered suite, so register a
  suite in the same turn it is written (25 Aug). The auction runner discovers suites by `readdirSync` — no such gap (1 Sep).
- Real Firestore data reaches the cloud only as his backup JSON attached to the chat. Extract the subset a task needs into
  a file with no names or e-mails before it goes near a repo; never print the backup's keys blind (3 Sep).

**The auction itself — facts that shape a build**
- The real auction runs TIMER MODE 2 (resets only when a bid affects others) — his words, 26 Aug. Current supply numbers
  are on the board, never in a document.
- Phase 4 always opens on Round 1 (his correction, 1 Sep). Rounds are phases to the simulator's "existing bids" count
  too (O-F, testing tool only; 7 Sep). He uses no old archives — everything before the real run is test data (1 Sep).
- The archived-round guard protects the bid being acted on, never the bystanders on the same week — D8, E1 and G1 all
  lived in that gap (G1–G3 built as 318); state any fix there as a rule about the WEEK (1 Sep).
- The honesty baseline for the next auction build is the last PUSHED build's SHA, from its BUILD-LOG row — never `HEAD~n`.

# PART A — SHARED

## STILL-OPEN NOTES CARRIED OUT OF RA-3 (20 Aug 2026)

*The RA-3 narrative was archived 25 Aug 2026 under §101. These two blocks were kept because they
are not narrative: one is an OPEN item, the other is a do-not-quote list. Everything else RA-3
produced is in `DECISIONS.md` §75–§78 and in the private reports in `tests/docs/`.*

**OPEN — the sandbox button sweep must be made to fail loudly.**

* **It had been measuring nothing since App Check went in (19 Aug).**
  `make-site.mjs` faked four Firebase modules but not `firebase-app-check`; offline that
  import failed and took every page handler with it. The staff pass clicked **0** controls;
  the admin pass logged 325 copies of one error. FIXED and pushed (`af57c09`): a new
  `sweep/fake/firebase-app-check.js` plus one line in `make-site.mjs`. After the fix, with the
  driver restored byte-for-byte: **584 clicks · 261 dialogs · 154 confirms · 0 errors**, both
  sites, four passes. STILL OPEN: make the harness fail LOUDLY (zero clicks on a site, or more
  page errors than clicks, must exit non-zero) — this rot was silent.
*(Three further bullets stood here and were archived with the narrative: the bidder-page refusal
placement, which SHIPPED as staff 162's H-3; the live walkthrough record; and that session's
battery counts.)*

### RA-3 honesty notes — things that did NOT survive, recorded so nobody quotes them

* The CRITICAL's original evidence cited an in-file comment that **does not exist** — the wave
  deleted it; it survives only on the `-` side of the diff. The skeptic caught it. The finding
  stands on its other, verbatim-accurate quote and on the reproduction.
* The CRITICAL's second scenario ("a bid of 10 wins outright") is **not settled** — the two
  agents disagreed, the reproduction is ambiguous, and the denial in it looks like a policy
  denial. **Do not quote it.** The clean case is the E/D one above.
* A 20,000-scenario fuzz Claude wrote to size the problem **proved nothing** — it flagged
  near-identical counts on both engines, so its oracle cannot separate a legitimate cascade
  from an inversion. Only signal worth noting: weaker-bid REVIEW promotions 242 post-wave vs
  31 pre-wave.
* Two items Claude nearly reported were wrong and the code said so: the greyed NP chip already
  carries its own reason, and the "No limit" bid caps really are set to 6/6.
* `audit-handlers.mjs` now prints 1 violation where 0 is expected. It is a **false positive** —
  line 6991 is a COMMENT quoting an onclick pattern, and the auditor has no comment stripping.

## 4. ARCHITECTURE — unchanged (the 29 Jul handoff's §4 ten-line summary is still accurate)

Two static sites + schedule app sharing one Firestore. All logic inline `<script>`. Two
computeApprovals twins differ in SIGNATURE deliberately; port logic only. Mail relayed by any open
signed-in page. Rules enforce per-user bid confinement via emailToUser (now collision-fail-closed),
server-clock timer, biddingClosed gate, append-only changes, admin-only decisions/backups.

## 5. DEPLOY FLOW — unchanged. Rules changes publish in the console BEFORE dependent client pushes.

# PART B — VACATION AUCTION


### LIVE STATE THE OWNER OWNS — kept here as REFERENCE, not as a reminder (25 Aug 2026)

**He asked for these off the queue** — *"I know the launch checklist, I don't need reminders"* and,
of the sign-in test, *"I'll mention it if it becomes a problem, stop reminding me."* **They are
recorded here so a fresh session knows the state and does not ask him again. Do NOT surface them
as work, and do not re-add them to `TODO.md`.** The full LAUNCH CHECKLIST and the sign-in section
are in `_archive/anesthesia/superseded-docs/TODO-archived-2026-08-25.md`, intact.

· **Outbid-alert and welcome e-mails are BOTH switched OFF.** Verified by RA-5: switching them on
  fires **no backlog** — neither generator keeps a "last notified" state, so there is nothing to
  replay. Worst case is two mails per physician at their next individual sign-in.
· **Launch has not happened.** It is his, on his timing.
· **35 participating anesthesiologists** (owner, 19 Aug). Older docs saying ~60 meant the roster
  size, not the number bidding.
· **Real-bidder sign-ins** were being tested. Any count predating the roster update to 35 is
  stale and must be recounted, never repeated. **28 Aug 2026, owner: *"Many users logged in
  successfully today."*** No number given; do not invent one. Still not a queue item.

**LIVE. Build numbers live in `TODO.md`'s STATUS block, which is generated** — the ones typed
here read 269/139/17 until 25 Aug 2026, thirty-five auction builds out of date. The cardinal rule
in `START-HERE.md` exists to protect this site.

> ⚠️ **Sections dated 3 Aug and earlier are HISTORICAL.** They were accurate when written and
> are kept for the reasoning they contain, not as a statement of today. The build numbers above
> and in `versions.json` are authoritative — do not trust a date heading below over them.


## ⭐ BACKLOG — pending updates (added 11 Aug 2026, after the first live rehearsal)

**Live state ~~right now~~ AS OF 11 AUG — HISTORICAL, live is 269/139/17:** admin **264** (F1 fix: Begin-Phase-4 clears the round
mirrors locally before the Round-1 month picker reads them), staff index **135**, mobile **17**;
versions.json matches. First live rehearsal with real users ran clean. The only real issue was a
data-entry typo — a user's corrupted KP e-mail (`...Bielinski.kp@org`, `@` misplaced) made EmailJS
return `422 "recipients address is corrupted"`, so that mailQueue entry looped forever (~every 90s
via claim expiry) and held the red "outbid alerts queued" flash lit. Fixed by correcting the roster
address; no code change. That episode surfaced items 2–4 below.

**Do these as ONE batched build AFTER the rehearsal is fully done** — full gate on all, user
pushes, code-freeze discipline (propose → user go → smallest change). Items 1–4 are small and
self-contained; **item 5 is behavioral/fairness-critical and needs the read-only touchpoint map
FIRST**, for the user to sign off on before any edit.

1. **noindex tag** — keep the site out of Google. Today there is no `noindex` meta and no honored
   robots.txt (a robots.txt under `/vacation/` is ignored — robots.txt must live at the host root,
   which is the *separate* `anesthesia-kp.github.io` repo). Fix = add
   `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` to the `<head>` of admin/index.html AND staff
   index.html. ~2 lines. The site is NOT currently indexed (a `site:` search returns nothing), so
   no urgency.

2. **Mail-queue hardening** — a permanently-rejected address is retried forever, never quarantined,
   so one bad e-mail can hold the queue's red flash hostage (see the rehearsal issue above). Fix =
   after N failed sends, drop/park the entry with an admin-visible flag instead of looping. See
   `processMailQueue` (admin ~line 1742, staff ~line 1452) and the
   `console.warn('Queue send failed for', e.user, err)` catch.

3. **Relabel the queue counter** — the dashboard "Outbid alerts — N queued" counts the WHOLE
   mailQueue outbox (welcome + results + outbid), so a stuck welcome shows up as an "outbid alert."
   Rename to e.g. "Queued e-mails." Cosmetic; see `updateMailQueueBadge` (~line 1714).

4. **EmailJS sent-counter undercount** — RECURRING; a prior fix did NOT hold. User reset it from
   ~280 to ~390 (dropped ~a third of sends). [BELIEVED] cause = lost concurrent increments: a
   read-modify-write in `trackEmailSent()` gets clobbered when multiple sends/tabs fire at once.
   Fix = atomic Firestore `increment(1)`, not read-then-set. DIAGNOSE `trackEmailSent` + its
   persistence path and CONFIRM the mechanism before changing anything (same discipline we used on
   the queue). Meanwhile the EmailJS account dashboard is the true count.

5. **Make holiday weeks + auction year admin-configurable (with guardrails)** — REPLACES the
   one-off "move spring break to weeks 14 & 15." Goal: no annual code rewrite — designate holiday
   weeks and set the auction year from the controls section (same stored-config pattern as
   timerRules / FTE caps / Smart Lock Controls in `adminSettings`). This is BEHAVIORAL and
   fairness-critical: it feeds `HIGH_DEMAND_WEEKS` → Phase-1 Smart Lock, FTE caps/slots, holiday
   labels, reports, and the never-event guards. **REQUIRED FIRST STEP = a read-only touchpoint map
   of EVERY place spring break / weeks 14-15 / high-demand weeks / FTE caps / holiday labels are
   defined or referenced, for the USER to sign off on before ANY edit.** Then wire those reads to
   config, add validation + a lock so the values can't change once an auction is underway, full
   gate + targeted fairness tests. The map is safe to build anytime (it changes nothing).

> NOTE: the sections below (dated 3 Aug 2026, admin 239) predate this rehearsal and are STALE on
> build numbers and suite counts. Trust the live state above; refresh §1 and the "Start here"
> command when the batch build lands.

## 6. DEFERRED / KNOWN-ACCEPTED — the 29 Jul list still stands, PLUS: passcodes retired
permanently; the refuted items in §3 above.

# PART C — DAILY SCHEDULE


### TRAP — TWO WAYS A GATE READ SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT YOU THOUGHT (25 Aug 2026)

Both were found in one evening, both had been live for weeks, and both printed clean numbers.

**① `SCHED_ROOT`, not `ADMIN`.** Most schedule suites take their page from `SCHED_ROOT`;
`build99-test` and `build100-test` take theirs from `ADMIN`. Passing the wrong one is **ignored,
not rejected** — the suite silently tests the working tree and returns the same number for every
input, which reads exactly like a clean bisect. It produced a confident, false "proven by
execution" claim that reached `BUILD-LOG.md` before a re-run caught it. **Before believing any
bisect, change the input and check the OUTPUT changed.**

**③ A SUITE THAT IS NOT IN `sched/run-all.mjs` NEVER RUNS.** The list is hand-kept, and builds
99, 100 and 101's suites were all missing from it — written, passed by hand, then silent, while
the battery reported a confident total that did not include them. **Register it in the same turn
you write it**, and when a battery total looks unchanged after adding a suite, that is the tell.

**⚠ AND ONE STANDING RULE IS NOW IN DOUBT, IN A GOOD WAY (25 Aug).** The rule says anything
that must be COMMITTED is written with `device_bash`, because `device_commit_files` files were
once invisible to git over the bridge. **That has now failed to reproduce twice**: the four
`.pptx` files on 24 Aug, and `tests/sched/build102-test.mjs` today — delivered with
`device_commit_files`, md5-identical to the cloud copy, and listed by `git status` as `??`
immediately afterwards. Two clean observations is not a proof, but the rule was written *"until
it is understood"* and it is now the expensive option for a large file. **Worth the owner's word
before relaxing it; until then, keep verifying md5 AND `git status` after any such transfer.**

**② A `/*` inside a line comment.** `admin/index.html` has three (`// … dailysched/*, …`). Any
comment-stripper that removes block comments first will open a block there and delete everything
to the next real `*/` — measured at 347,322 characters. The page is valid JavaScript; the
stripper was the bug. **Strip line comments first, then block comments, and assert what survived.**

**Build numbers live in `TODO.md`'s STATUS block, which is generated** — the ones typed here
read 63/28 until 25 Aug 2026, thirty admin builds out of date. In active development.

## THE RULINGS — read them in `DECISIONS.md` (this repo), not here

An index of every ruling used to live here. It stopped at §41 while DECISIONS ran to §53b —
an incomplete copy claiming to be complete, which is worse than no copy. **`DECISIONS.md` is
the authority and its headings ARE the index** (§1–§53b, plus the buried-rulings index at
the end of that file). Do not re-litigate anything there; rulings marked as overruling
Claude mean Claude argued the opposite and was told no.

## Four traps a fresh session will fall into

1. **Module scope.** Both pages are one `<script type="module">`. A plain `function foo`
   is invisible to inline `onclick=`/`oninput=` handlers **and** to `page.evaluate` in
   tests. This has already caused one shipped-quality bug (`renderElig`, caught by the
   harness) and two false test failures. Expose with `window.foo=foo`, and assert through
   the DOM rather than by poking internals.
2. **The fake Firestore must fail like the real one.** `mergeFields()` catches an
   `updateDoc` rejection and retries with `setDoc`, so a one-shot denial is absorbed
   silently — `window.__denyPath` is sticky for that reason. And `tx.set` is synchronous
   in the real SDK; an earlier version of the fake dropped the rejected promise and
   reported denied writes as successful, which would have hidden exactly the bug class
   these tests exist to catch.
3. **A fixture's `versions.json` must match the `var BUILD` of the bytes under test.**
   From build 50 both pages carry a stale-build gate: on a mismatch the page reloads
   itself mid-run and wipes the seeded fakes. It looks exactly like a page bug and is not
   one — it cost most of an hour on 16 Aug. Both harnesses now read the number out of the
   file, so they keep working on every future build; do not reintroduce a hardcoded one.
4. **The fake auth starts SIGNED OUT.** Hiding `#authGate` is not enough — nothing has
   fired `onAuthStateChanged`, so the page never resolves who it is talking to and every
   grid renders header-only. Call `window.__signInNow()`. On 16 Aug this made `elig-test`
   report 8 failures against a page that was completely fine; adding the call took it
   straight back to 33/0 with no change to the page at all.

   Both of these have the same shape, and it is the shape to watch for: **a red test that
   is the harness's fault reads exactly like a red test that is the code's fault.** Before
   believing a new failure, run the same suite against the PREVIOUS build. If it fails
   there too, the harness moved, not the page.
5. **The `requiredBuilds` ratchet cannot be ported naively.** Whoever brings the auction's
   stale-build ratchet across must give it **its own key namespace**: the schedule's `PAGE`
   values are `'index'` and `'admin'` — the very same keys the auction ratchets — so a direct
   port would have schedule admin 93 compare itself against the AUCTION's admin build and
   reload-gate forever. (Promoted here 25 Aug 2026 from the 24 Aug schedule reconciliation,
   whose narrative was archived under §101.)

## Design artefacts — delivered, NOT built

`design/` holds six previews, three specs and a README (statuses corrected 17 Aug — several shipped; each file now carries a dated status banner). They are **mockups, not the app** — no
Firebase, no real data, every invented value labelled (§22).

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `elig-grid-preview.html` | the eligibility rebuild — **shipped in 49** |
| `shift-editor-preview.html` | stage 1 — times, sites, stacking demand rules, 60-day preview |
| `reports-preview.html` | stage 9 — **shipped in 51** |
| `REQUEST-TYPES.md` + `request-types-preview.html` | the owner's 27-entry Task list, modelled |
| `ASSIGNMENT-MODEL.md` + `assignment-model-preview.html` | stage 3 — the preview reproduces defect 2 live |
| `RULES.md` + `rules-preview.html` | stage 5 — **blocked on roles/groups**, two questions flagged |
| `shift-times.xlsx` | the owner's worksheet. **Not an import** — §38 parks every estimate |

## Next actions

**The queue lives in ONE place: `TODO.md` §1 (this repo).** The list that used to sit here
went stale within a day of being written (it still ordered a push that had long landed and
called defect 1 open after build 61 closed it). This file records what happened; TODO
orders what happens next.

---

# PART D — RESCUED RECORDS, 16 Aug 2026

Everything in this part existed in exactly ONE place, and that place was a file that looks
obsolete and was a candidate for archiving. It was lifted here on 16 Aug so that archiving
those files costs nothing. **Sources are named at each section; the source files keep their
original text as historical evidence.**

---

## D1 · Open residuals on the LIVE auction → the vacation section of `TODO.md`

The auction's deliberately-open defects and their mitigations have ONE home:
**the vacation section of `TODO.md` in this repo** (one-TODO ruling, 17 Aug). Do not restate them anywhere else; point there. It carries M1, M3, L2, L3, L4 and the cosmetic items, each with what neutralises it.

Two things to know without opening it:

- **M3 was never triaged, and it reproduces on the live build.** The two sites disagree about
  a doctor's e-mail address whenever that address contains a capital letter, because the KP
  address is not normalised on save and only one of the two sites lower-cases what it returns.
  Reproduced 16 Aug by extracting and executing both sites' real functions. Whether it has
  ever fired depends on whether any stored KP address has a capital letter — a data question,
  answerable on the admin Users page.
- **M1's mitigation is complete and is an operating habit, not code:** a single admin runs the
  auction. The same is true of L3: after Reset Auction, Global Lock ON until Begin Phase 1.

> ⚠️ **ID COLLISION.** Part B of this file contains items also labelled **M1, L2 and L3** —
> those are the **31 Jul Batch-D** numbering and are different, closed defects. The residuals
> file uses the **25 Jul code-review** numbering. Never quote a bare ID; name the list.

---

## D2 · Phase 4 — rounds as mini-phases. The lifecycle, in one place

*(18 Aug 2026: the REHEARSAL's phase 4 was skipped by owner ruling — this lifecycle was never exercised live. It remains the reference for real phases run with rounds.)*

*Rescued from NEXT-SESSION-PROMPT-2026-08-11 (now `_archive/tests/session-docs/`), which was the only
human-readable description of this machine anywhere in the project. The mechanism is
implemented in both pages and pinned by `tests/test-p4-rounds.mjs` (154 assertions) — but a
suite tells you what breaks, not how the thing is meant to work.*

**In plain terms:** Phase 4 is not one phase with many decisions. It is a series of small
phases. Each round closes, gets decided, gets archived, gets mailed, and only then does the
next round open. Nothing a doctor sees moves until the results for that round have actually
been sent.

**The sequence, quoted from the 11 Aug record:**

> close bidding → decide → Complete Round N (archives to admin-only staging `pendingP4Rounds`)
> → Send Round N Results (mails that round, publishes archive to `phases.p4Rounds[N]` +
> `p4RoundResultsSent[N]`) → Start Round N+1 (retires denied bids from `schedule` + `bidPhase`,
> clears approvals/denials/worstBids docs, `p4Round++`, smart-lock reopen) → … → Complete
> Phase 4 (gated: current round archived, all rounds sent, no orphan live decisions; year
> record = union of round archives; finish via `_p4FinishStamp`).

**The invariants, likewise quoted:**

> announced round wins lock via `getPriorPhaseWinners` (`p4RoundWinnersOn`) on BOTH sites;
> announced denials freeze until retirement (staff `p4AnnouncedDecision`); unsent results never
> visible to users; archived decisions immutable (`_p4ArchivedDecisionRound` guards
> approve/deny/revoke, pending counts, decide panel); plain Reopen redirects to Start Round
> when round archived; reports/history/filters treat rounds like phases ('Phase 4: Round N').

**Why each invariant is there, in one line:** results are not visible before they are sent, so
nobody learns their outcome early. An archived round cannot be re-decided, so the record of
what was announced cannot drift. Both sites agree on who won, so the two pages never show
different answers to the same doctor.

---

## D2a · Requested next auction feature (17 Aug 2026) — capacity-by-week report

The owner's first post-Phase-3 feature request: a report on the Reports dash, beneath the
user summaries, showing **each week of the year with what's been taken and what's
available**, styled like the existing reports. Verbatim wording and the one open scoping
question were in `TODO.md` §1 B4. **B4 SHIPPED as build 271 and B4's entry was archived
25 Aug 2026** to `_archive/anesthesia/superseded-docs/TODO-archived-2026-08-25.md`; the shipped record is the
build-271 row of `vacation-kp.github.io/BUILD-LOG.md`. This note is kept as the dated record of
when the feature was queued.

## D3 · A dated capacity ceiling on a live document

*Same source, and it appeared nowhere else in the project.*

> phases doc grows ~20KB/round (watch vs 1MB late 2027)

The `phases` document grows by roughly 20KB each Phase-4 round. Firestore caps a single
document at 1MB. On the growth rate observed in August 2026 that becomes a problem around late
2027. **This is not urgent and it is not theoretical** — it is a dated arithmetic fact about a
document the live auction writes every round. Tracked as a watch item in
`vacation-kp.github.io/TODO.md`.

---

## D4 · Operating habits for the live auction

*Rescued from §5 of SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-08-07 (now `_archive/tests/session-docs/`). Several of these are carried
elsewhere already; the three marked ★ were carried nowhere.*

1. **Run as the sole admin.** Most residual risks require two simultaneous admins.
2. **The timer may expire on its own** — safe since build 244. The admin machine's clock should
   be OS-synced. ★ **Keep one admin page open at and after expiry** so auto-close can fire; the
   manual Close Bidding path still works either way.
3. **Rehearsal Mode was once found unexpectedly OFF.** Verify the banner state before a
   rehearsal (ON) and before a real launch (OFF). Reset keeps it armed by design.
4. **After any Reset:** Global Lock ON until Begin Phase 1. See L3 in the residuals file.
5. **E-mail quota:** the in-app meter is advisory; **EmailJS's dashboard is the source of
   truth.** ★ The app's cycle resets on a configurable day, **default the 22nd**, which may
   differ from EmailJS's own billing day — that mismatch is why the meter can under-state.
6. **Send (or rehearsal-skip) each phase's results before beginning the next phase.** Build 245
   auto-targets an earlier unsent phase, but do not rely on it live.
7. ★ **Don't reload the admin dashboard mid-presentation**, and give it ~2s after opening.

---

## D5 · Accepted design decisions — do NOT relitigate

*Rescued from §6 of the same file. The first is carried in Part A; the rest were carried
nowhere.*

- `computeApprovals` has deliberately different signatures on the two sites (admin: an
  `ignoreAdmin` boolean; staff: a schedule snapshot). Port the logic only, never the signature.
- Reset Auction keeps Rehearsal Mode armed.
- **Review overage up to 1.0 is allowed**, and overage locks while the current phase has bids —
  including after the final phase. A reset clears it.
- **No e-mail-domain restriction.** *(Settled July 2026. Anything that would refuse an address
  for its domain — including a non-blocking "that doesn't look like a KP address" warning — is
  a change to this decision and needs the owner to say so explicitly.)*
- Passcodes are retired. The staff site does not auto-reconnect.
- The NP phase toggle is superseded by the high-demand week rule: Phase-1 weeks are all
  high-demand, so an NP-in-P1 toggle is moot. That is correct behaviour, not a bug.
- **Priority-lock OFF legalises below-floor bids, and re-enabling it does not unwind them.**
- **Raising a cap auto-raises later phases' caps.**

## 9 Sep 2026 — "Vacation Auction 9 Sep 2026 V3" — §190: THE FINAL AUDIT, RA-11. READ-ONLY. THREE FINDINGS AWAIT HIS RULING. NOTHING BUILT.

Opened with START-HERE attached (read from disk); ritual clean: live 330 / 170 / 18 and 151 / 51 fetched twice with different cache-busters,
all four repos clean and in sync (hub `810fd06`, auction `a7c8f7d`, schedule `0a61585`, tests `459fc0f` judged from disk), three fetch
`maintenance.lock`s moved to `_to_delete/git-locks/`. TODO's STATUS block was stale (generated before his commits) — noted, regenerated
at the end of this session. Named V3 because V2 already heads today's earlier entry. Context at open 129k.

**His order:** *"Go with the audit. Ensure this includes a multi-agent review and adversarial pass."* Recorded as §190 the same turn.

**How it ran (the record is `tests/docs/RA-11-2026-09-09.md`, private):** cloud clone at the Mac's HEADs, `tests` tarred minus
`node_modules` and staged, every served file md5-identical Mac ↔ cloud (staff `f46bd976…`, admin `92e4eed0…`, rules `2999a64b…`).
Gates read directly: battery **80 suites / 2,728 assertions, exit 0, cloud AND Mac** (79 executed, `test-rules-emulator` skipped in both
sandboxes — his RA-2 of today, 177 / 177, is the coverage; auction honesty baseline left absent on purpose, regression gate on unchanged
bytes); isolation 36 / 36 both machines; `node --check` clean on 4 + 4 + 1 inline scripts. Then five independent review lanes from one
written brief (CRITICAL / HIGH only, cite the line you read, grep DECISIONS and the battery before calling anything a defect, a clean
lane is a valid result), a red-team agent that attacked the seams and executed extracted functions, and an independent verifier that
re-derived every surviving candidate from its own reads and executed the real functions in fixtures. Claude re-read the F1 sinks itself.
Agent spend ≈ 1.6 M tokens across the seven agents.

**Verdict:** the engine, caps, holds, floors, timer, close, results, phase and round boundaries, restore, auth, rules containment, spend
and the §189 code held against everything tried. Three findings survived the verifier — **F1** CRITICAL (insider precondition: three
admin report windows render a colleague's raw bid value unescaped into a same-origin window with a live opener; rules check the key,
never the value), **F2** CRITICAL blast radius (insider precondition, admin-recoverable: no size bound on own-key bid-doc writes, one
shared 1 MiB document), **F3** HIGH (no precondition: the FTE-overage dial never unlocks in any real between-phases gap — a second
client lock, older than the build-268 gap unlock; executed in three gap fixtures, refused in all three). Each needs his specific
decision under §92; the fix shapes are in the report; nothing was built. The red team's mail-quota HIGH was demoted by the verifier to
a documented operating condition (runbook 25–41; est. 750–1,100 mails in Phase 1 vs 2,000 / cycle). Below-the-bar items are listed
once in the report §3 and NOT queued.

**Paperwork this session:** `tests/docs/RA-11-2026-09-09.md` (new, with its line-2 answers note); RA-10's note no longer says "THE
CURRENT AUDIT"; DECISIONS §190 + index row; TODO §1 (the audit outcome and the three items awaiting his ruling, one line each);
this entry; `node status.mjs` re-run on the Mac. Two repos change — the hub and `tests` — neither a one-file commit. Delivered the three
ways: `COMMIT-MESSAGES.txt` in the outputs column, `<repo>/COMMIT-MESSAGE.txt` on disk, and the zip unpacked with `unzip -p`,
md5-verified per file. Memory correction from lane 1: users CAN cancel a bid on a projected-win week (rule removed 12 Jul 2026).

**Lessons, dated 9 Sep V3.** (1) The engines were audited for forged VALUES; the DISPLAYS never were — "the engine ignores it" is not
"the page ignores it". (2) A rules residual written for one dimension (value) said nothing about another (size); when a residual is
accepted, name what it does NOT cover. (3) Two gates AND-ed on one control, written at different times, can each be right and together be
always-false — execute the control in the state it promises, not just its parts. (4) An independent verifier that must EXECUTE the
claim killed one HIGH and hardened two CRITICALs — the second skeptic is worth its tokens.

**His ruling, same session:** *"go"* — asked which (a general go is not a §92 decision), he chose **F1 + F3 + F2** from written options
(§190). **BUILT as admin 331 + `firestore.rules`, honesty baseline `4f71695`.** Exploration first: every bid doc's per-user value is a
map (`{[user]:{[wk]:v}}`, `bidLowerings` `{used:n}`), `emailToUser` maps an address to a one-element list (collisions excluded), so a
key-count bound on `myInitials()[0]` is safe for every client shape. The edits, anchored and counted: three `${esc(b.bid)}` cells
(3980 / 7834 / 7935), `w.opener=null` after both `window.open` (7685 / 8168), `syncControls` and `_confirmSaveReviewThreshold` on
`cfgUnlockedNow()` alone with the status line and caption kept true, `var BUILD` 331 + `versions.json`, rules `ownMapBounded()` on the
bid-doc branch (60 keys; non-map own value left alone; no new document access).
**Gates, read directly:** `test-331-report-escape-threshold.mjs` 27 / 27 (executes the real builders, `openReportTab`, and the
threshold handler in five fixtures); honesty on `4f71695` **15 RED, exit 1**; `test-330`'s VERSIONS pin re-anchored (≥ and agrees
with `var BUILD` — what was ASSERTED moved, not what is true; its own honesty block untouched); `rules-emu/assertions.mjs` gains the
"Bid map bound (9 Sep, RA-11 F2)" generation — 10 assertions, 3 gates, **RA-2 is his run**; cloud battery **81 / 2,755 exit 0**
(emulator suite skipped, as always here); isolation 36 / 36; `node --check` clean; sweep **361 · 13 · 294 · 13 clicks, 159 dialogs,
139 confirms, 0 errors**; adversarial fresh-agent review of the diff: no findings (it re-checked `esc` hoisting, legitimate labels
unchanged, opener semantics, the gap freeze, every rules construct against forms already live in the file, every staff write shape,
the emulator seeds and gate polarity). **Mac, after the unpack (all 17 md5s identical): battery 81 / 2,755 exit 0; honesty on `4f71695` 15 red, exit 1; isolation 36 / 36; `status.mjs` exit 0 with the FILED line.**
**Delivered the three ways:** `COMMIT-MESSAGES.txt` (three repos; none a one-file commit), `firestore-rules.txt` (⚙️ caption,
md5 = repo), `build-331-files.zip` → `_to_delete/xfer/`, unpacked per file with `unzip -p`, every md5 identical to the cloud.
BUILD-LOG row 331 (*pending*); §190 ruling and status; TODO §1; START-HERE FILED line. This entry took HANDOFF over its 900-line
tripwire, so the 8 Sep V1 entry (the docs pass — its facts are §188, the plan doc and the retrieval check) was moved verbatim to
`HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md` with `archive.mjs`; `status.mjs` exit 0.

**Pushed (same session):** auction `1a4e269`, tests `aa78be8`, hub `7781288`; 331 / 170 / 18 served, fetched twice with different
cache-busters. **Rules published in the console (his word: "updated rules"). RA-2, his run:** 186 / 186 on the current rules; honesty
against the old rules (`28bae0c` baseline) 22 red — Feed 4 / 4, Bid holds 4 / 4, User Activity 11 / 11, **Bid map bound 3 / 3** —
"BOTH: the current rules pass, and the old rules fail the new gates." START-HERE's LIVE line is 331 / 170 and the FILED line retired;
BUILD-LOG row 331 carries the SHA and the RA-2 numbers; §190 marked LIVE. Three fetch locks moved to `_to_delete/git-locks/`.
**Next auction honesty baseline: `1a4e269` (admin 331 / staff 170).**

**Closing checklist, run at his word ("run closing", 9 Sep 2026):** 0 · fetch on the three public repos — all `main...origin/main`,
tests judged from disk (in sync); nine fetch locks moved over the day to `_to_delete/git-locks/`. 1 · chat reviewed — his order, his
choice from options, "pushed", "updated rules" and the RA-2 numbers are in §190 (grepped on disk); the memory correction (cancel on a
projected-win week IS allowed) is in §190 and RA-11 §5; the lessons are above; the below-the-bar items are RA-11 §3 by his brief and
are NOT queued; the brief the lanes ran from is filed as `tests/docs/RA-11-BRIEF-2026-09-09.md` (it existed only in the cloud).
2 · state files true — START-HERE LIVE 331 / 170, no FILED line, LAST REVISED 9 Sep; BUILD-LOG row 331 with SHA + RA-2; TODO §1
carries the one-line state; `node status.mjs` exit 0, every governing file under its tripwire (HANDOFF 878 / 900 after the 8 Sep
V1 entry was archived). 3 · code proven — the numbers above are from the runs: battery 81 suites / 2,755 assertions exit 0 on BOTH
machines (80 executed, 1 skipped — the emulator suite, covered by his RA-2 186 / 186), honesty by explicit SHA `4f71695` 15 red exit 1
on both, isolation 36 / 36 both, `node --check` clean, sweep 0 errors (cloud), adversarial review of the diff no findings. 4 · files —
uncommitted on disk: `vacation-kp.github.io/BUILD-LOG.md` (the SHA + RA-2 row edit, a ONE-file commit), the hub's DECISIONS /
HANDOFF / START-HERE / TODO, and `tests/docs/RA-11-BRIEF-2026-09-09.md` (new, a ONE-file commit) — all docs, three commit messages in
the outputs column; the cloud clone is BEHIND origin since his pushes and is not a base for anything. 4a · rubbish — `_to_delete/`
holds 24 MB / 43 files (this session: the tests tarball, three zips, nine locks; earlier: the 330 zip, the docs-pass zip, a spent patch
script) — his to empty; nothing loose in a repo; `Claude outputs/`, `COMMIT-MESSAGE.txt` and `firestore-debug.log` are gitignored where
they sit. 5 · handed over: 331 / 170 / rules live; nothing queued on the auction; §92 and §164 stand; the schedule parked.

## 9 Sep 2026 — "Vacation Auction 9 Sep 2026 V4" — 331 VERIFIED END TO END (SERVED BYTES, CONSOLE RULES, LIVE SMOKE, APP CHECK); §191 THE RETURNED-BID SENTENCE, BUILT AS ADMIN 332 / STAFF 171. FILED, NOT PUSHED.

Opened with START-HERE attached (read from disk); ritual clean: live 331 / 170 / 18 and 151 / 51 fetched twice with different cache-busters,
all four repos clean and in sync (hub `cc710af`, auction `ca923a2`, schedule `0a61585`, tests `b95a2bb` judged from disk); no locks before
the fetch, three `maintenance.lock`s after it, moved to `_to_delete/`. Context at open 118k.

**His question: "is there a useful check or confirmation for the recent build we did?"** Claude's reading: 331's repo bytes were proven every
way (tests, honesty, battery, sweep, review, his RA-2) but two inches between the repo and the world were not — the SERVED page vs the repo
(only `versions.json` had been fetched after the push) and the PUBLISHED rules vs the repo (RA-2 proves the file on disk, not what the
console holds). He chose all three offered checks, all read-only, run in his Chrome:
- **Served = repo:** `admin/index.html` (960,087 B) and `index.html` (287,081 B) fetched from origin (`x-cache: MISS`) hash SHA-256-identical
  to the disk copies at `1a4e269`; `mobile.html` and `versions.json` too. Method: `fetch` + `crypto.subtle` in a same-origin tab.
- **Console rules = repo:** the newest release in Firebase → Firestore → Rules (Today 10:15 AM, starred, no draft pending) read out of the
  CodeMirror model: 673 lines, 48,035 B + the trailing newline the editor drops = 48,036 B, SHA-256 identical to `firestore.rules`.
  `ownMapBounded` present. Note for next time: the Chrome extension redacts hex strings in tool output — return the digest as a byte array.
- **Live admin smoke:** he completed the Google popup; page runs BUILD 331, zero console errors across a full reload; the FTE-overage dial
  reads editable at 0.4 with "Phase 1 has not begun" (F3 as promised for the current state); Bids-by-Week report opened as a document —
  table rendered, `opener === null` (F1 live). No writes: the admin site logs no admin sign-ins (only the staff site writes `loginLog`).
- **App Check (he took the screenshots):** Cloud Firestore **Enforced**, 100 % valid / 0 % invalid; Authentication Monitoring (by the
  standing rule — never Auth), 93 / 7; the web app registered with reCAPTCHA v3; the key's Domains list = `anesthesia-kp.github.io` only,
  "Verify the origin" checked; Owners shows the single-owner triangle (explained, not acted on).
Struck by him: item 2 (e-mail end-to-end — his own live test is in the record) and the billing-alert half of item 3 (§171(3) "his and
handled" — Claude re-raised it and should not have). His "anything else?" twice: no.

**§191 — owner-found while reading the staff rules:** *"the bids are actually not returned until next phase starts."* Confirmed in code:
retirement is the Begin Phase batch (§71 boundary scrub) / Start Round — never Complete or Send Results; the sentence in the staff box, the
staff welcome e-mail and the admin's copy said "when the phase (or Phase 4 round) completes". His ideal (return at Send Results) pushed
back as a fairness-area engine change days from go-live; bidding is closed in the gap anyway, so the defect is what a user sees between
results and the next Begin. Options A (text) / B (text + gap hint) / C (keep the gap short) — **"Go with A"**, then his sentence verbatim:
*"Bids that do not win are returned to you when the next phase begins."* (his choice over the longer draft with the round and capacity
qualifiers). Deck checked at his ask: never carried the wrong sentence (slide 9 "subsequent phases", slide 34 "for the next phase") — no
change; adding the bullet to slide 33 for parity is his call. His question on the User Bids key chip "withheld AND on a bid" answered
from RA-10/§183: reachable only via restore, a stale tab, or a hand edit — never the UI's own paths.

**BUILT as admin 332 / staff 171** (edits made on the Mac with count-asserted `python3`, mirrored in the cloud clone, md5 identical both
ways): the sentence in three places, `var BUILD` 171 / 332, `versions.json`. `tests/test-332-returned-wording.mjs` (new): 19 / 19, executes
the REAL `buildWelcomeEmailBody` on both pages, plus the INVARIANCE that baseline box and baseline executed welcome bodies equal the current
ones once the one sentence is substituted; honesty on `1a4e269` **11 red, exit 1** (Mac and cloud). `test-166` / `test-319` S2 pins
re-anchored (the target moved, not the truth) — both still red on their own baselines (165: 11 red; 318/165: 55 red). Battery **82 / 2,774
exit 0** on BOTH machines; isolation 36 / 36 both; `node --check` 4 + 4 clean; sweep **361 · 13 · 294 · 13 clicks, 159 dialogs, 139
confirms, 0 errors** (the standing staff/confirm `unlocated=1`, unchanged since 323/167). No adversarial agent review — three sentence
substitutions and two build bumps, invariance-proven; said so in the BUILD-LOG row. `firestore.rules` untouched: no console paste, no RA-2.

**Paperwork this session:** DECISIONS §191 (+ index row, status FILED); BUILD-LOG row 332 (*pending*); TODO §1 FILED line; START-HERE FILED
line (LAST REVISED already 9 Sep); this entry, which took HANDOFF over its 900-line tripwire, so the 9 Sep V2 entry (its facts:
§189, BUILD-LOG row 330, the V3 entry) was moved verbatim to `HANDOFF-ARCHIVE.md` with `archive.mjs`; `node status.mjs` exit 0. Three repos change — auction (4 files), tests (3 files), hub (4 files) — none a one-file
commit. Delivered the three ways. **Next auction honesty baseline after his push: the 332/171 SHA; until then `1a4e269`.**

**Lessons, dated 9 Sep V4.** (1) "Verified" had stopped one file short twice: the served page was inferred from `versions.json`, the published
rules from the repo file. The last inch is cheap to close and belongs in the post-push ritual. (2) A rules sentence written for the user is a
claim about the engine — the display audit of RA-11 (lesson 1 there) applies to PROSE too; the owner found it by reading his own site.
